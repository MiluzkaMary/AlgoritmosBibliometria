        "abstract": "The recent literature on reasoning biases in psychosis and delusions is reviewed. The state-of-the-art knowledge from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the evidence for jumping to conclusions is briefly summarised, before a fuller discussion of the more recent empirical literature on belief flexibility as applied to delusions. The methodology and evidence in relation to studies of belief flexibility and the Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence (BADE) across the delusional continuum will be critically appraised, and implications drawn for improving cognitive therapy. It will be proposed that dual process models of reasoning, which Kahneman (Kahneman, 2011) popularised as ‘fast and slow thinking’, provide a useful theoretical framework for integrating further research and informing clinical practice. The emergence of therapies which specifically target fast and slow thinking in people with distressing delusions will be described.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new proposal of an efficient computational model of face recognition which uses cues from the distributed face recognition mechanism of the brain, and by gathering engineering equivalent of these cues from existing literature. Three distinct and widely used features – Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Principal components (PCs) extracted from target images are used in a manner which is simple, and yet effective. The HOG and LBP features further undergo Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Our model uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to classify these three features and fuse them to form a sparsely connected model. A computational theory is first developed by using concepts from the information processing mechanism of the brain. Extensive experiments are carried out using eight publicly available face datasets to validate our proposed model’s performance in recognizing faces with extreme variation of illumination, pose angle, expression, and background. We also investigate the same mechanism because of reasons discussed later, on object recognition tasks as well. Results obtained are extremely promising when compared with other face and object recognition algorithms including CNN and deep learning-based methods. This highlights that simple computational processes, if clubbed properly, can produce competing performance with best algorithms.",

        "abstract": "While games of chance have been played for thousands of years, and while experienced players often had good intuitive ideas of the relative frequencies of various outcomes, the concept of probability as referring to the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes of a ‘fair’ gambling device emerged only 500 or so years ago in Western societies. That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life—as for example in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient—more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.",

Geographic information systems (GIS) and science are a big part of computational human geography but the notion is considerably broader, encompassing spatial process modeling and simulation, the modeling of spatial decision and behavior, visualization techniques, most aspects of spatial analysis, and an increasing number of other areas. Computation in human geography goes back to the beginnings of the quantitative revolution and is philosophically related though methodologically distinct from it. Two major thrusts have persisted through the years: the use of numerical techniques to solve large, complex quantitative problems; and the development of models of complex spatial processes expressed directly in computational terms. Typical exponents of the latter kinds of applications are cellular automata models of urban and environmental processes, and agent-based models of spatial decision and behavior. More recent developments involve applications of mobile and portable computing. Critiques of computational human geography originate from both within the field and from the humanistic and social theory perspectives. The former address a number of epistemological and methodological problems while the latter tend to focus on issues of ontology and representation.",

        "author": "Fadi Thabtah and Firuz Kamalov and Khairan Rajab",
        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the fastest growing developmental disability diagnosis. General practitioners (GPs) and family physicians are typically the first point of contact for patients or family members concerned with ASD traits observed in themselves or their family member. Unfortunately, some families and adult patients are unaware of ASD traits that may be exhibited and as a result do not seek out necessary diagnostic services or contact their GP. Therefore, providing a quick, accessible, and simple tool utilizing items related to ASD to these families may increase the likelihood they will seek professional assessment and is vital to the early detection and treatment of ASD. This study aims at identifying fewer, albeit influential, features in common ASD screening methods in order to achieve efficient screening as demands on evaluating the items’ influences on ASD within existing tools is urgent. To achieve this aim, a computational intelligence method called Variable Analysis (Va) is proposed that considers feature-to-class correlations and reduces feature-to-feature correlations. The results of the Va have been verified using two machine learning algorithms by deriving automated classification systems with respect to specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and predictive accuracy. Experimental results using cases and controls related to items in three common screening methods, along with features related to individuals, have been analysed and compared with results obtained from other common filtering methods. The results exhibited that Va was able to derive fewer numbers of features from adult, adolescent, and child screening methods yet maintained competitive predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates.",

Many forms of data were collected: Desmos activities, videos of research lessons (RLs), videos of MTE RL debriefings, artifacts of student learning in the Desmos Dashboard, and MTEs' written self-reflection. The authors investigate the teacher educators' learning through LS by analyzing the MTE debriefings of the RLs using Bannister’s (2015) framework for teacher learning in communities of practice.\nFindings\nThe MTEs learned to enact equitable mathematics instruction using technology through addressing emerging issues related to intellectual authority and use of student thinking. Throughout the LS, the MTEs sought ways of promoting students' mathematical authority and using student thinking through features of the Desmos platform.\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis study focuses on MTEs' learning without examining participating preservice teachers' learning. It demonstrates the benefits of LS for MTEs' professional learning.\nPractical implications\nThis study showcases how a research-based Desmos activity is used and refined to promote MTE learning how to implement equitable mathematics instruction.\nOriginality/value\nThe study contributes to better understanding of how LS could be used to develop MTEs' professional learning. Moreover, the dual process of participation and reification was concretized through diagnostic and prognostic frames in the LS context, which enriches the concept of community of practice.",

From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements. It is concluded that the results are suggestive of the validity of the new scale and warrant further research.",

In fact, most of the practical applications involves non-conjugate models, thus approximate methods, such as the MCMC algorithms, are required. Although these methods can deal with quite complex structures, some practical problems can make their applications quite time demanding, for example, when we use heavy-tailed distributions, convergence may be difficult, also the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can become very slow, in addition to the extra work inevitably required on choosing efficient candidate generator distributions. In this work, we draw attention to the special functions as a tools for Bayesian computation, we propose an alternative method for obtaining the posterior distribution in Gaussian non-conjugate models in an exact form. We use complex integration methods based on the H-function in order to obtain the posterior distribution and some of its posterior quantities in an explicit computable form.

Experimental and clinical studies have provided great insight into the physiology and biochemistry of the retina; however, there are questions which cannot be answered using these methods alone. Mathematical and computational techniques can provide complementary insight into this inherently complex and nonlinear system. They allow us to characterise and predict the behaviour of the retina, as well as to test hypotheses which are experimentally intractable. In this review, we survey some of the key theoretical models of the retina in the healthy, developmental and diseased states. The main insights derived from each of these modelling studies are highlighted, as are model predictions which have yet to be tested, and data which need to be gathered to inform future modelling work. Possible directions for future research are also discussed. Whilst the present modelling studies have achieved great success in unravelling the workings of the retina, they have yet to achieve their full potential. For this to happen, greater involvement with the modelling community is required, and stronger collaborations forged between experimentalists, clinicians and theoreticians. It is hoped that, in addition to bringing the fruits of current modelling studies to the attention of the ophthalmological community, this review will encourage many such future collaborations.",

Moving such laboratory experiences online when remote learning became necessary has resulted in a new model for CUREs that utilizes free online databases to provide not only a novel research experience for students, but also the opportunity to engage in big data analysis. Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 min in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis. While cancer-specific, this analysis platform appeals to a wide range of classes and student interests. Further, the project has been successfully done both as an independent research experience and as part of a virtual class-based research project.",

This combination of accuracy and efficiency will significantly enhance real-time depth estimates during flood events, support detailed sensitivity analyses, and allow for the generation of large ensembles to enable complex uncertainty analyses.",

Visual thinking is a process that has the allocation of attention as its very essence. Attention, however, is multifaceted. Making an eye movement is an act of attending. Eye movements are executed to satisfy the need for information and can be thought of as a sequence of visual queries on the visual world. The idea of the visual query is shorthand for what one does when obtaining information either from the world at large or from some kind of information display. Understanding what visual queries are easily executed is a critical skill for the designer. The special skill of designers is not so much skill with drawing or graphic design software, although these are undoubtedly useful, but the talent to analyze a design in terms of its ability to support the visual queries of others. One reason why design is difficult is that the designer already has the knowledge expressed in the design and has seen it develop from inception and therefore cannot see it with fresh eyes. The solution is to be analytic and this is where this book is intended to have value. Effective design should start with a visual task analysis, determine the set of visual queries to be supported by a design, and then use color, form, and space to efficiently serve those queries.",

Through a transdisciplinary literature review, this study reveals that AI enhances creativity by providing inspirational stimuli, and supports evaluation and decision-making.

        "author": "Yuan Yuan and Xuanbin Guo and Dandan Ma",
        "abstract": "Poor visibility caused by rainy image can have a negative impact on the performance of computer vision applications. While several image deraining algorithms have been popularly adopted, most of them suffer from two main limitations: (1) they cannot well handle real and complex rain scenes by only focusing on one type of rain in images (e.g. raindrops or rain streaks) whereas the reality often coexists with both types, (2) they face significant difficulties in practical application because of ignoring the speed of inference. To address the above problems, we propose a global attention network (GANet) that can quickly and effectively separate rain streaks and raindrops. Inspired by the fact that rain in images often appears white, we leverage this prior to obtain an initial rain-free background image to guide neural network-based image deraining. Moreover, a new global attention block (GAB) is designed to simultaneously extract the rain features from spatial and channel dimensions. By cascading multiple GABs, the proposed method can effectively obtain the features of rain streaks and raindrops and progressively separates the rain-free image. Furthermore, owing to the nonlinear properties of GAB, the activation functions are omitted, which can speed up the inference time. And the depth-wise and point-wise convolutions are employed to promote computation efficiency as well. Extensive experiments on raindrop and rain streak datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 37.53 dB PSNR on Rain100L with an inference speed of 39 FPS, which is 2–30 times faster than competitors.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive framing effects have been widely reported in higher-level decision-making and have been ascribed to rules of thumb for quick thinking. No such demonstrations have been reported for physical action, as far as we know, but they would be expected if cognition for physical action is fundamentally similar to cognition for higher-level decision-making. To test for such effects, we asked participants to reach for a horizontally-oriented pipe to move it from one height to another while turning the pipe 180° to bring one end (the “business end”) to a target on the left or right. From a physical perspective, participants could have always rotated the pipe in the same angular direction no matter which end was the business end; a given participant could have always turned the pipe clockwise or counter-clockwise. Instead, our participants turned the business end counter-clockwise for left targets and clockwise for right targets. Thus, the way the identical physical task was framed altered the way it was performed. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that cognition for physical action is fundamentally similar to cognition for higher-level decision-making. A tantalizing possibility is that higher-level decision heuristics have roots in the control of physical action, a hypothesis that accords with embodied views of cognition.",

Results of neu-rosimulations indicate the incremental influence of DA and NA over computational resources of a psycho-emotional state while 5-HT decreases the computational resources used to calculate a psycho-emotional state.

Given the known antidepressant-like effects of incensole and incensole acetate, we herein present that the low dose intraperitoneal administration of incensole derivatives, namely, incensfuran and incensone, showed significant antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Furthermore, these compounds were evaluated for their anxiolytic potential in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and light dark box (LDB) tests and anticonvulsant effects in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure tests. In the EPM test, administration of these compounds led to dose-dependent increases in open arm entries and in the time spent in EPM open arms. Similar results were obtained in the LDB test, wherein compounds these caused significant increases in the number of transitions between lit and dark compartments and the time spent in the lit compartment. The anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM were not reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil, whereas PTZ and bicuculline (BIC) completely abolished the anxiolytic effects, showing the involvement of the non-benzodiazepine binding sites of GABAA receptors. All four compounds induced significantly elevated brain GABA levels, indicating the involvement of a GABAergic mechanism. Additionally, molecular docking was conducted to elucidate the mode of action for the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of these derivatives. Moreover, these compounds also possess drug-like properties and excellent ADMET profiles.",

The study demonstrates how machine learning efficiently assesses student moral education performance by leveraging PCA to identify patterns and using ML models to make accurate predictions. Findings reveal a strong correlation between subject proficiency in mathematics, reading, and writing and moral reasoning abilities, highlighting the role of academic competencies in ethical decision-making. Additionally, gender-based analysis indicates that female students tend to achieve better results in moral skills assessments than their male counterparts. Among the models tested, SVR exhibits the highest predictive accuracy, whereas k-NN returns the widest prediction errors. The study recommends the deployment of AI-based moral assessment systems in universities to ensure consistent and objective evaluation processes for policy development.",

An optimal setup ensures efficient mass transfer with high surface area while keeping down the pressure drop, which leads to energy savings and better absorption. TPMS structures such as the Gyroid, Schwarz-P, and Schwarz-D were investigated in this study, with a focus on balancing porosity and surface area to achieve reduced pressure drops and optimal phase contact. Single-phase flow simulations were conducted using the commercial software STAR- CCM+, compared to the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to provide an alternative perspective on fluid dynamics. Validation, analysis of the results and identification of possible improvements were achieved through these comparisons. According to the results, the Schwarz-D structure with 70% porosity and 2 mm unit cell leads to the best performance, exhibiting a pressure drop of 655 Pa m-1 and a specific surface area of 1776 m2 m-3 when analysed with STAR-CCM+. The predicted pressure drop was successfully confirmed using LBM simulations, adding robustness to the findings.",

Children solved multidigit subtraction problems in one choice condition, in which they were free to choose between direct subtraction and indirect addition, and in two no-choice conditions, in which they had to use either direct subtraction or indirect addition. Furthermore, children were randomly assigned to mental computation, written computation, or free choice between mental and written computation. One third of the children adaptively switched their strategy according to the number characteristics of the problems, whereas the remaining children consistently used the same strategy. The likelihood to adaptively switch strategies decreased when written computation was allowed or required, compared to mandatory mental computation. On average, children were adaptive to their own speed differences but not to the accuracy differences between the strategies.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we rigorously assess the performance of three gradient-free optimization algorithms—Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA)—for estimating source terms in diverse radionuclide release scenarios. Our analysis encompasses both single and multiple sources with varying radionuclide compositions, delving into the influence of decay constants and radioactivity on source estimation accuracy. Although estimating a single radionuclide from a single source exhibits outstanding results, estimating multiple radionuclides from a single source proves more arduous due to the limited information available for discerning gamma dose rates. Contrary to expectations, increasing the number of observation stations does not consistently improve the likelihood of finding accurate solutions in ill-posed inverse problems. Impressively, under our simulation settings, EKI demonstrates competitive performance in terms of convergence, accuracy, and runtime compared to PSO and GA, with GPU parallelization further bolstering computational efficiency. We explore strategies for enhancing source term estimation, including incorporating prior information, applying uncertainty removal techniques, and optimizing observation placement. Additionally, this study underscores the intricate role of relative error in determining multi-radionuclide estimation accuracy from gamma dose measurements. By employing the Gaussian plume model under steady-state conditions, our research lays the groundwork for future applications of Lagrangian dispersion models with real-time data integration. The insights gleaned from our study promise to advance environmental radioactivity monitoring and catalyze the development of cutting-edge, real-time source estimation technologies in full-scale systems.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems are an emerging technology that facilitates real-time vehicle-to-everything communication. Hence, securing and authenticating data packets for intra- and inter-vehicle communication are fundamental security services in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, public-key cryptography (PKC) is commonly used in signature-based authentication, which consumes significant computation resources and communication bandwidth for signatures generation and verification, and key distribution. Therefore, physical layer-based secret key extraction has emerged as an effective candidate for key agreement, exploiting the randomness and reciprocity features of wireless channels. However, the imperfect channel reciprocity generates discrepancies in the extracted key, and existing reconciliation algorithms suffer from significant communication costs and security issues. In this paper, PKC-based authentication is used for initial legitimacy detection and exchanging authenticated probing packets. Accordingly, we propose a blockchain-based reconciliation technique that allows the trusted third party (TTP) to publish the correction sequence of the mismatched bits through a transaction using a smart contract. The smart contract functions enable the TTP to map the transaction address to vehicle-related information and allow vehicles to obtain the transaction contents securely. The obtained shared key is then used for symmetric key cryptography (SKC)-based authentication for subsequent transmissions, saving significant computation and communication costs. The correctness and security robustness of the scheme are proved using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN)-logic and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulator. We also discussed the scheme’s resistance to typical attacks. The scheme’s performance in terms of packet delay and loss ratio is evaluated using the network simulator (OMNeT++). Finally, the computation analysis shows that the scheme saves ∼99% of the time required to verify 1000 messages compared to existing PKC-based schemes.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate, at a fine-grained level of detail, the theorems-in-action deployed and the constraints encountered by middle-school students in reasoning reversibly in the multiplicative domain of fraction. A theorem-in-action (Vergnaud, 1988) is a conceptual construct to trace students’ reasoning in a problem solving situation. Two seventh grade students were interviewed in a rural middle-school in the southern part of the United States. The students’ strategies were examined with respect to the numerical features of the problem situations and the ways they viewed and operated on fractional units. The results show that reversible reasoning is sensitive to the numeric feature of problem parameters. Relatively prime numbers and fractional quantities acted as inhibitors preventing the cueing of the multiplication–division invariant, thereby constraining students from reasoning reversibly. Among others, two key resources were identified as being essential for reasoning reversibly in fractional contexts: firstly, interpreting fractions in terms of units, which enabled the students to access their whole number knowledge and secondly, the unit-rate theorem-in-action. Failure to conceptualize multiplicative relations in reverse constrained the students to use more primitive strategies, leading them to solve problems non-deterministically and at higher computational costs.",

        "author": "Hans J. Pasman and William J. Rogers and M. Sam Mannan",
        "abstract": "Risk assessment is essential for various purposes such as facility siting, safeguarding, and licensing. Hazard identification (HAZID), which suffers greatly from incompleteness, is still the weakest link in risk assessment. Of course, this recognition is not new and many efforts have been spent to improve the situation, of which some have been rather successful. To find out what can go wrong, creative divergent thinking is required. Hazard identification should result in scenario definition. In that respect, applying the present tools as HAZOP and FMEA there is still a great emphasis on the material and equipment aspects. In contrast, underlying management and leadership failure in its many forms reflecting in organizational and human failure, due to complexity, attracts much less attention. Unlike in HAZID, in accident investigation the occurrence of an event with nasty consequences is no doubt a fact, so there must be one or more causes and the traces will lead to them. Over the years, methods for accident and incident investigation have gone through a significant evolution. From the early-on simplistic domino stone model and the human operator always at fault, via models of latent failure due to failing management involvement and via extensive root cause analysis (RCA) to a system approach. Hence, in accident investigation, management failure appearing in the many possible forms of human and organizational factors, obtained already 30 years ago with the RCA technique much attention, while it nowadays culminates in the socio-technical system approach. So, the question arises whether for improved HAZID we can learn from the accident investigation experience. In addition, safer design and advances from static risk assessment towards more accurate predictive operational dynamic risk assessment and management, will also be enabled by possibilities offered by big data and analytics. Digitization, automation and simulation, hence computerization, will be of great help in improving the identification of hazards and tracing the corresponding scenarios. The paper reviews the developmental history of both accident investigation and hazard identification methodology; incidentally it will identify commonality and differences. On the basis of the comparison and of recent advances in computerization, the paper will investigate to what extent beneficial modifications and additions can be made to obtain a higher degree of completeness in HAZID.",

Next follows an overview of data mining of Big Data (which involves these main activities) and its importance in business. Then we distinguish the field of probability (where, based on assumptions, we reach conclusions about what is likely to happen—a useful exercise in business where nobody knows for sure what will happen) from the field of statistics (where we know from the data what happened, from which we infer conclusions about the system that produced these data) while recognizing that probability and statistics will work well together in future chapters.

        "abstract": "Background and objective:\nFor the emerging significance of mental stress, various research directives have been established over time to understand better the causes of stress and how to deal with it. In recent years, the rise of video gameplay has been unprecedented, further triggered by the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several researchers and organizations have contributed to the practical analysis of the impacts of such extended periods of gameplay, which lacks coordinated studies to underline the outcomes and reflect those in future game designing and public awareness about video gameplay. Investigations have mainly focused on the “gameplay stress” based on physical syndromes. Some studies have analyzed the effects of video gameplay with Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc., without concentrating on the relaxation procedure after video gameplay.\nMethods:\nThis paper presents an end-to-end stress analysis for video gaming stimuli using EEG. The power spectral density (PSD) of the Alpha and Beta bands is computed to calculate the Beta-to-Alpha ratio (BAR). The Alpha and Beta band power is computed, and the Beta-to-Alpha band power ratio (BAR) has been determined. In this article, BAR is used to denote mental stress. Subjects are chosen based on various factors such as gender, gameplay experience, age, and Body mass index (BMI). EEG is recorded using Scan SynAmps2 Express equipment. There are three types of video gameplay: strategic, puzzle, and combinational. Relaxation is accomplished in this study by using music of various pitches. Two types of regression analysis are done to mathematically model stress and relaxation curve. Brain topography is rendered to indicate the stressed and relaxed region of the brain.\nResults:\nIn the relaxed state, the subjects have BAR 0.701, which is considered the baseline value. Non-gamer subjects have an average BAR of 2.403 for 1 h of strategic video gameplay, whereas gamers have 2.218 BAR concurrently. After 12 minutes of listening to low-pitch music, gamers achieved 0.709 BAR, which is nearly the baseline value. In comparison to Quartic regression, the 4PL symmetrical sigmoid function performs regression analysis with fewer parameters and computational power.\nConclusion:\nNon-gamers experience more stress than gamers, whereas strategic games stress the human brain more. During gameplay, the beta band in the frontal region is mostly activated. For relaxation, low pitch music is the most useful medium. Residual stress is evident in the frontal lobe when the subjects have listened to high pitch music. Quartic regression and 4PL symmetrical sigmoid function have been employed to find the model parameters of the relaxation curve. Among them, quartic regression performs better in terms of Akaike information criterion (AIC) and R2 measure.",

        "abstract": "Social atomism is the thesis that an individual considered in isolation can have thoughts with a determinate conceptual content. Social holism, by contrast, is the thesis that social relations are essential for a human being in order to be a ‘thinking’ being. The discussion on atomism vs. holism extends to aspects of thoughts as well. Semantic atomism is the thesis that each thought has a meaning independently of other thoughts. Semantic holism, in reverse, is the thesis that the meaning of a thought consists in its inferential relations to other thoughts in a system of thoughts. Confirmation atomism is the thesis that thoughts can be empirically confirmed one by one. Confirmation holism, by contrast, is the thesis that only a whole system of thoughts or a whole theory can be confirmed by experience. Social atomism in modern philosophy goes back to Hobbes. Social holism comes up in romanticism and its predecessors; it is worked out by Hegel. In today's discussion, the rule-following considerations that are developed by Kripke on behalf of the later Wittgenstein are the main argument for social holism. Social atomists counter this argument by a naturalistic account of rule following in terms of certain dispositions to behavior.",

        "author": "Adriano S. Rodrigues and Marcos R.O.A. Maximo and Marcus H. Victor",
        "abstract": "In mechanically ventilated patients, some lung injuries can be reduced or avoided with therapy individualization, while the lung function is evaluated continuously, breath by breath. However, obtaining information on respiratory mechanics (respiratory system resistance and compliance) in the presence of respiratory effort is challenging, even if using invasive and complex procedures. The contribution of this work is to predict both respiratory system resistance and compliance over time using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and estimate the respiratory effort profile using the respiratory dynamics. Therefore, the approach used in this work was to generate a large amount of simulated data to feed a CNN so it could learn how to predict the correct values of the respiratory system resistance and compliance. Then, the respiratory effort was estimated by solving a first-order linear model. The main results showed a normalized mean squared error of 5.7% for the respiratory system resistance and 11.56% for compliance from Bland-Altman plots derived from the computational simulator. Finally, the method was validated using real data from an active lung simulator within which respiratory mechanics varied, and some ventilator settings were adjusted to mimic actual patient situations. The active lung simulator effort profile was obtained with a normalized mean squared error of 8.31% considering the use of an active lung simulator. The results have shown that the simulated data were valuable for the CNN training, while the performance over the real data suggested that the network was generalized accordingly for estimating respiratory parameters and effort profile.",

        "abstract": "Despite increasing interest in emotional processes in cognitive science, theories on emotion regulation have remained rather isolated, predominantly focused on cognitive regulation strategies such as reappraisal. However, recent neurocognitive evidence suggests that early emotion regulation may involve sensorimotor control in addition to other emotion-regulation processes. We propose an action-oriented view of emotion regulation, in which feedforward predictions develop from action-selection mechanisms. Those can account for acute emotional-action control as well as more abstract instances of emotion regulation such as cognitive reappraisal. We argue the latter occurs in absence of overt motor output, yet in the presence of full-blown autonomic, visceral, and subjective changes. This provides an integrated framework with testable neuro-computational predictions and concrete starting points for intervention to improve emotion control in affective disorders.",

        "abstract": "This review concentrates on the issue of acquisition of abstract words in a cognitive robot with the grounding principle, from relevant theories to practical models of agents and robots. Most cognitive robotics models developed for grounding of language take inspiration from the findings of neuroscience and psychology to get the theoretical skeleton of these models. To better understand these modelling approaches, it is indispensable to work from the base (theoretical accounts) to the top (computational models). Therefore in this paper, succinct definition of abstract words is presented first, and then the symbol grounding issue and accounts of grounded cognition for abstract words are given. The next section discusses the computational modelling approaches for abstract words grounding phenomenon. Finally, important cognitive robotics models are reviewed. This paper also points out the strengths and weaknesses of relevant hypotheses and models for the representation of abstract words in the grounded cognition framework and helps the understanding of issues such as where and why modelling efforts stand to address this problem in comparison with theoretical findings.",

        "author": "Michael J. Hogan",
        "abstract": "In a recent contribution to New Ideas in Psychology, Seán O’Nualláin draws out a distinction between inner and outer empiricism, and suggests that consciousness research can benefit from analysis in both directions, that is, via the exploration of facts and relations that facilitate a third-person understanding of consciousness (by reference to an analysis of the structures, processes, and functions of the brain) and via the direct exploration of conscious experience itself, both in terms of its computational (content filled) and non-computational (content empty) aspects. In positing a substrate of subjectivity independent of the contents of consciousness (and, more specifically, a state of “nothingness”), Ò’Nualláin follows a long tradition deeply rooted in mythical, religious, and esoteric schools of belief and practice. Although there is considerable debate amongst philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists as to whether or not a non-computational view of consciousness is viable, O’Nualláin accepts that such a possibility does exist. Further, he suggests that a dialogue between the inner and outer empiricists will be fruitful. In this comment I, critique Ò’Nualláin's initial thoughts on the subject and draw out a series of useful distinctions that will help to advance the dialogue between inner and outer empiricism. Critical amongst these distinctions is explicit reference to (1) ontological and epistemological interdependencies in consciousness research, and (2) states of consciousness that describe the transition from “mindfulness” through “nothingness” to “no-mind”.",

        "abstract": "Experience-related brain activity patterns reactivate during sleep, wakeful rest, and brief pauses from active behavior. In parallel, machine learning research has found that experience replay can lead to substantial performance improvements in artificial agents. Together, these lines of research suggest that replay has a variety of computational benefits for decision-making and learning. Here, we provide an overview of putative computational functions of replay as suggested by machine learning and neuroscientific research. We show that replay can lead to faster learning, less forgetting, reorganization or augmentation of experiences, and support planning and generalization. In addition, we highlight the benefits of reactivating abstracted internal representations rather than veridical memories, and discuss how replay could provide a mechanism to build internal representations that improve learning and decision-making.",

        "author": "Dietrich Albert and Michael D. Kickmeier-Rust and Fumiko Matsuda",
        "abstract": "The developmental course in the distance–speed–time domain is still a matter of debate. Traditional stage models are contested by theories of continuous development and adaptive thinking. In the present work, we introduce a formal framework for modelling the developmental course in this domain, grounding on Competence-based Knowledge Space Theory. This framework, as a more general case, widely includes assumptions and facets of previous models and covers empirical findings collected based on different experimental paradigms. By a distinction of latent competences and observable performance, model validation is not bound to a certain experimental paradigm and no one-to-one correspondence between competences and tasks is required. Therefore, the framework has the potential to bridge the gap between stage models and models of continuous development. The approach also precisely defines misconceptions, for example overgeneralization, and empirically investigates their occurrence. In the present work, we established a prototypical model for the development of understanding the distance–speed–time system. We extended this model with definitions based on different perspectives of overgeneralization. The assumptions of the model and its extensions were examined on the basis of the results of two empirical investigations using six judgment task types. The results yielded a reasonably good fit of model and data. No evidence was found for the occurrence of overgeneralization in this domain. The theoretical model and empirical results are discussed with respect to their relationship to other developmental models and theories.",

        "abstract": "The principal objective of this paper is to argue the thesis that a science concerned with the study of behaviour requires the computational approach in a serious way for its theoretical advancement. It is pointed out that modelling behaviour requires the articulation of explanations at three levels. The methodology of computational simulations is indispensable to articulating explanations at the first level which underlie explanations at the other two levels. The paper contrasts the currently fashionable approaches in artificial intelligence studies to the kind of constraints viable behavioural models must satisfy. Teachability and open-endedness are two of the essential characteristics of organisms that any satisfactory model must have. It is argued that analogy-based computational techniques and paradigmatic learning/teaching techniques are two modelling aspects that require imaginative study.",
