Structural models in psychotherapy conceptualize human mind in terms of levels of information processing (both internal and external information). We suggest that a mental split between mind and body leads to a feeling of estrangement from self, as well as an estrangement from external world. Drawing on relational approaches on psychotherapy, we suggest that focusing on perceiving own sensations does not necessarily imply a state of personal isolation from outside world; rather, this simultaneously means the perceiving and acceptance of “otherness”.}

Accurate evaluation of SA statuses across these three levels is crucial for mitigating human false-positive and false-negative rates in monitoring complex scenarios in the aviation context. This study proposes a comprehensive comparative analysis by involving two types of physiological records: electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) images. These two modalities are leveraged to automate precise SA evaluation using both conventional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques. Benchmarking experiments reveal that the BEAM-based deep learning models attain state-of-the-art performance scores of 0.955 for both SA perception and comprehension levels, respectively. Conversely, the EEG signals-based manual feature extraction, selection, and classification approach achieved a superior accuracy of 0.929 for the projection level of SA. These findings collectively highlight the potential of deploying diverse physiological records as valuable computational tools for enhancing SA evaluation throughout aviation decision-making safety.}

Anecdotal evidence has indicated that psychedelic substances may acutely enhance creative task performance, although empirical support for this claim is mixed at best. Clinical research has shown that psychedelics might have enduring effects on mood and well-being. However, there is no neurocognitive framework that ties acute changes in cognition to long-term effects in mood. In this review, we operationalize creativity within an emerging cognitive control framework and assess the current empirical evidence of the effects of psychedelics on creativity. Next, we leverage insights about the mechanisms and computations by which other psychoactive drugs act to enhance versus impair cognition, in particular to those that act on catecholamines, the neurophysiological consequences of which are relatively well understood. Finally, we use the same framework to link the suggested psychedelic-induced improvements in creativity with enduring psychedelic-induced improvements in mood.}

The findings reveal fluctuations in research productivity, with a peak in 2022 driven by increased reliance on technology following the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States dominates contributions to this field, accounting for nearly half of the total publications, while emerging nations like Indonesia demonstrate significant potential for growth. Co-occurrence analysis identifies five thematic clusters, highlighting cognitive skills, curriculum design, and emerging tools such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and game-based learning. Content analysis shows that quantitative methods, particularly true-experimental designs, are the most common, with secondary school students (47 %) as the primary sample group. Achievement tests are the predominant data collection method, often complemented by observations and surveys for comprehensive insights. The focus on physics as the most studied subject (35 %) underscores its versatility, while multidisciplinary studies reveal a growing interest in sustainability, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

The researchers utilized a characterization of evolving fraction conceptions developed from research of children without disabilities that was ultimately productive in facilitating conceptual advances of the child with LD.

Digital infrastructures, i.e., ICT systems, or system-of-systems, providing digital capabilities, such as storage and computational services, are experiencing an ever-growing demand for data consumption, which is only expected to increase in the future. This trend leads to a question we need to answer: How can we evolve digital infrastructures to keep up with the increasing data demand in a sustainable way?
Objective:
The goal of this study is to understand what is the future of sustainable digital infrastructures, in terms of: which solutions are, or will be, available to sustainably evolve digital infrastructures, and which are the related adoption factors, impediments, and open problems.
Method:
We carried out a 3-phase mixed-method qualitative empirical study, comprising semi-structured interviews, followed by focus groups, and a plenary session with parallel working groups. In total, we conducted 13 sessions involving 48 digital infrastructure practitioners and researchers.
Results:
From our investigation emerges a landscape for sustainable digital infrastructures, composed of 30 solutions, 5 adoption factors, 4 impediments, and 13 open problems. We further synthesized our results in 4 incremental scenarios, which outline the future evolution of sustainable digital infrastructures.
Conclusions:
From an initial shift from on-premise to the cloud, as time progresses, digital infrastructures are expected to become increasingly distributed, till it will be possible to dynamically allocate resources by following time, space, and energy. Numerous solutions will support this change, but digital infrastructures are envisaged to be able to evolve sustainably only by (i) gaining a wider awareness of digital sustainability, (ii) holding every party accountable for their sustainability throughout value chains, and (iii) establishing cross-domain collaborations.}

This associative memory is essential to associative thinking, logical reasoning, imagination and computation. In terms of cellular mechanisms underlying associative memory, new mutual synapse innervations are formed among those coactivated neurons, so that they are recruited to be associative memory cells or associative memory neurons. These associative memory cells receive new synapse innervations alongside innate synapse inputs and encode signals carried by these inputs. We proposed to examine microRNAs as initiative factors for recruiting new synapse innervations and associative memory cells. In a mouse model of associative memory characterized as the reciprocal retrieval of associated whisker and odor signals, barrel and piriform cortical neurons gain their ability to encode whisker and odorant signals based on the newly formed synapse innervations between these coactivated cortices besides innate synapse inputs. miRNA-324 and miRNA-133a are required for recruiting these new synapse innervations and associative memory cells as well as sufficient for facilitating their recruitments, but not for innate synapse inputs. Therefore, the coactivation of sensory cortices through microRNA as initiative factor to recruit new mutual synapse innervations and associative memory cells for associative memory.}

Different from concept learning and formal concept analysis that learn new concepts from data and the general decision rule that comes from an independent decision table, this paper cognizes an existing concept by decision rules that come from multiple granularities. Specifically, 1) concept cognition for knowledge graphs is realized from the perspective of mining multi-granularity decision rule. 2) Decision tables corresponding to four granularities form a multi-granularity decision table group, and then the result from coarser granularity can guide and help obtaining the result from finer granularity. 3) We propose a framework for mining multi-granularity decision rules, which involves going from a multi-granularity decision table group to the frequent maximal attribute patterns to the decision rules to the credible decision rules. Finally, we verified effectiveness of dividing positive and negative data, monotonicity of attribute patterns in a multi-granularity decision table group, and downward monotonicity of credibility, and observed the impact of the parameter min_cov and min_conf on execution times.}

abstract = {Object-goal Navigation (ObjectNav) involves locating a specified target object using a textual command combined with semantic understanding in an unknown environment. This requires the embodied agent to have advanced spatial and temporal comprehension about environment during navigation. While earlier approaches focus on spatial modeling, they either do not utilize episodic temporal memory (e.g., keeping track of explored and unexplored spaces) or are computationally prohibitive, as long-horizon memory knowledge is resource-intensive in both storage and training. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Memory-MambaNav model, which employs multiple Mamba-based layers for refined spatial–temporal modeling. Leveraging the Mamba architecture, known for its global receptive field and linear complexity, Memory-MambaNav can efficiently extract and process memory knowledge from accumulated historical observations. To enhance spatial modeling, we introduce the Memory Spatial Difference State Space Model (MSD-SSM) to address the limitations of previous CNN and Transformer-based models in terms of receptive field and computational demand. For temporal modeling, the proposed Memory Temporal Serialization SSM (MTS-SSM) leverages Mamba’s selective scanning capabilities in a cross-temporal manner, enhancing the model’s temporal understanding and interaction with bi-temporal features. We also integrate memory-aggregated egocentric obstacle-awareness embeddings (MEOE) and memory-based fine-grained rewards into our end-to-end policy training, which improve obstacle understanding and accelerate convergence by fully utilizing memory knowledge. Our experiments on the AI2-Thor dataset confirm the benefits and superior performance of proposed Memory-MambaNav, demonstrating Mamba’s potential in ObjectNav, particularly in long-horizon trajectories.

Additionally, CKD is associated with various dietary factors, including liver failure, diabetes, anemia, nerve damage, inflammation, peroxidation, obesity, and other related conditions. Therefore, early prediction of CKD is important to progress the functionality of the kidney. In recent times, IoT has been widely used in a diversity of healthcare sectors through the incorporation of monitoring devices such as digital sensors and medical devices for patient monitoring from remote places. To overcome the problem, this research proposed a conceptual architecture for CKD detection. The sensor layer of the architecture includes IoT devices to collect data and the proposed classifier, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), utilizes the Anova-F feature selection technique to effectively detect CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease). In addition to MLP, four other classifiers including ANN (Artificial Neural Network), Simple RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and SVM (Support Vector Machine), are employed for comparative analysis of accuracy. Furthermore, three additional feature selection techniques, namely Chi-squared, SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection), and SBFS (Sequential Backward Floating Selection), are utilized to evaluate their impact on the accuracy of CKD detection. Our proposed method outperforms all other approaches with a remarkable accuracy of 99 % while maintaining efficient computational time.

The first step in creating such models is the derivation of a so-called “computational theory” of the adaptive problem each psychological specialization has evolved to solve. In Part II, as a case study, a sketch of a computational theory of social exchange (cooperation for mutual benefit) is developed. The dynamics of natural selection in Pleistocene ecological conditions define adaptive information processing problems that humans must be able to solve in order to participate in social exchange: individual recognition, memory for one's history of interaction, value communication, value modeling, and a shared grammar of social contracts that specifies representational structure and inferential procedures. The nature of these adaptive information processing problems places constraints on the class of cognitive programs capable of solving them; this allows one to make empirical predictions about how the cognitive processes involved in attention, communication, memory, learning, and reasoning are mobilized in situations of social exchange. Once the cognitive programs specialized for regulating social exchange are mapped, the variation and invariances in social exchange within and between cultures can be meaningfully discussed.}

This process is supported by engram literature, which posits that neurons are allocated to a memory trace based on excitability and that reactivation induces excitability.

abstract = {The ubiquitous sameness of urban greenways prompts questions on generative design grammar and syntax, whether creative, critical rethinking at that level might be lacking. However the design syntax of urban greenways is not explicitly discussed thus leaving a critical gap in knowledge. This paper begins tackling the larger question by acting on the fundamental subset of it, by operationalizing the design syntax of urban greenways. This is done through mathematics-based graph studies to analyze patterns and shapes, photography based thermal, material and morphology studies, and section analyses to make imagery-derived deductions on the design syntax. Recommendation on approaches to diversify and enrich the design syntax includes a more direct reference from ecosystem science theories such for siting and planning the urban greenways at macro- to meso-scale, a mixed-method approach, combining mathematics, photography and drawings based frames for analyses at meso-, to micro-scale, and a turtle view scale for designing at meso- to micro-scale, with an emphasis on latter.}

This chapter discusses the desirability of developing computational models of conversational phenomena, and the supportive role given to conversation analysis (CA) in the development of such models. The arguments presented in this chapter are not an attempt to restrict the range of creative resources that software designers might turn to for inspiration. In particular, it is implicitly endorsed in the attempts to develop descriptively adequate models of conversation for use in computer systems, and explicitly endorsed when it is argued that by providing a simulacrum of conversation one has naturally occurring conversation between computers and humans. The attraction of CA for people who want to develop rules of conversational organization that can be used to program computers is two-fold: (1) CA might seem to provide a ready-made package of conversational rules that they can use or adapt for their purposes; and (2) their models may be authorized by appealing to CA. However, CA is used to authorize computational models of conversation that misrepresent the details of how conversation works.}

We propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. We specifically propose that children’s learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.}

The notion of granularity is developed, which allows fine-tuning the expressive possibilities of the semantic network. As known, the central issues for knowledge-based systems are what’s-in-a-node and what’s-in-a-link. As shown, the answer can be obtained from the functor-as-object representation. Then the nodes are functors, and the main links are natural transformations. Such a model is applicable to represent morphing, and the object is considered as a process, which is in a harmony with current ideas on computing. It is possible to represent information channels that carry out the transformations of processes. The possibility of generating displaced concepts and the generation of families of their morphs is shown, the evolvent of stages of knowledge and properties of the process serve as parameters.}

We studied the role of syntax in arithmetic thinking, a neglected component of numerical cognition, by examining eye movement sequences during the calculation of arithmetic expressions. Specifically, we investigated whether, similar to language, an expression has to be scanned sequentially while the nested syntactic structure is being computed or, alternatively, whether this structure can be extracted quickly and in parallel. Our data provide evidence for the latter: fixations sequences were stereotypically organized in clusters that reflected a fast identification of syntactic embeddings. A syntactically relevant pattern of eye movement was observed even when syntax was defined by implicit procedural rules (precedence of multiplication over addition) rather than explicit parentheses. While the total number of fixations was determined by syntax, the duration of each fixation varied with the complexity of the arithmetic operation at each step. These findings provide strong evidence for a syntactic organization for arithmetic thinking, paving the way for further comparative analysis of differences and coincidences in the instantiation of recursion in language and mathematics.}

Secondly, a misclassification cost matrix is tailored to different driving needs. Finally, inspired by the complex neural networks found in the human brain, we develop a specialized lightweight neural network, termed the Width Human-like Neural Network (WNN), aimed at realizing personalized cognition and facilitating human-like decision-making in driving intention. Experimental studies and validation based on natural driving trajectory data from Kunming, China, demonstrate that the method accurately infers internal implicit driving intention from external explicit and observable driving behaviors, achieving a prediction accuracy of 99.8%.

Our model recapitulates the data described in recent whole-cell system biology simulations and provides a structural representation for all MG proteins, DNA and RNA molecules, obtained by combining experimental and homology-modeled structures and lattice-based models of the genome. We establish a framework for gathering, curating and evaluating these structures, exposing current weaknesses of modeling methods and the boundaries of MG structural knowledge, and visualization methods to explore functional characteristics of the genome and proteome. We compare two approaches for data gathering, a manually-curated workflow and an automated workflow that uses homologous structures, both of which are appropriate for the analysis of mesoscale properties such as crowding and volume occupancy. Analysis of model quality provides estimates of the regularization that will be required when these models are used as starting points for atomic molecular dynamics simulations.}

This cognitive process is responsible for the generation and transformation of risk under different conditions. At the core of risk theory is a generic descriptive risk model. This risk model can be used to describe most risks seen in real life with a unified underlying logic. In the risk model, the human cognitive process of risk takes into account both the target value expectation and the realistic value expectation of cognitive subjects, and considers the disparity between them in terms of human values. Hence, risk in a variety of forms represents the disparity between the ideals of people and the cognitive reality of values. The risk model is quantitative. In the risk model, all elements from risk perception to risk cognition can be constructed quantitatively in terms of formal logic and probability. This renders most questions in the risk theory computational by nature. The model represents the cognitive disparity in terms the target value expectation and the realistic value expectation of the cognitive subject. Then the risk model is able to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for the cognitive disparity to become perception.}

abstract = {The study constructs computational models of neurons in order to examine the contribution that their response dynamics may make to functional properties at the system level. As described in the accompanying study, neurons in the cardiorespiratory nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) of the rat were recorded in vitro. When these cells were intracellularly injected with a constant current pulse, spike discharge patterns and subthreshold voltage trajectories were observed that were time- and voltage-dependent. The accompanying manuscript describes these dynamic responses in 4 classes of putative second-order cells that appear to receive direct primary afferent input, and a previous paper described two populations of rhythmically firing interneurons, one of which is intrinsically auto-active. In the present manuscript experimental neuronal voltage response data was collected across a current injection series for the S3 neuron type described in the accompanying study and for the auto-active neuron described previously. Using this data, computational model neurons have been constructed for these two neurons by using membrane ion channels to produce and match the observed neuronal voltage behavior. The channels were those implicated in the dynamic responses observed in the companion study, and include gNafast, gKdr, gKA, gKCa, gKAHP, gKM, gCaT and gCaL. The description of channel kinetics follows the Hodgkin-Huxley form. Different neuronal sources from the literature of channel kinetics were investigated and assembled into a ‘channel kinetics library’ from which both neuron models were tuned, primarily by adjusting the maximum channel densities, g¯, and time-dependence of kinetics. Methods are described for tuning the channel kinetics library to match various physiological responses. This approach created neuron models that were able to closely replicate the observed complex voltage and spiking responses of the two very different cardiorespiratory NTS neurons. The interaction of voltage- and calcium-dependent conductances were analyzed for their functional contributions by tuning their kinetics. Specific parameters are given that account for the behavior of each model. Sensitivity analyses by perturbing KCa and KA are are shown for both neurons, and I/F curves are presented for the auto-active neuron's simulated and recorded responses. The potential systems-level functional implications resulting from the different kinetics is demonstrated by driving the S3 model neuron in simulation with the pattern of input produced by model primary baroreceptor afferents. The limitations and significance of this approach are discussed. The present study of model neurons are being extended to the larger family of neurons found in the cardiorespiratory NTS (e.g. S1, S2 and S4), are being related to the baroreceptor vagal reflex by in vivo studies, and are being used to explore systems level computation, for example by creating networks reflecting baroreceptor reflex organization. The present kinetics library in principle could be used in this way for other neuronal systems.}

Computational approaches for characterizing object similarity have largely focused on the visual forms of objects or their linguistic associations. However, intuitive notions of object similarity may depend heavily on contextual reasoning—that is, objects may be grouped together in the mind if they occur in the context of similar scenes or events. Using large-scale analyses of natural scene statistics and human behavior, we found that a computational model of the associations between objects and their scene contexts is strongly predictive of how humans spontaneously group objects by similarity. Specifically, we learned contextual prototypes for a diverse set of object categories by taking the average response of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to the scene contexts in which the objects typically occurred. In behavioral experiments, we found that contextual prototypes were strongly predictive of human similarity judgments for a large set of objects and rivaled the performance of models based on CNN representations of the objects themselves or word embeddings for their names. Together, our findings reveal the remarkable degree to which the natural statistics of context predict commonsense notions of object similarity.}

Data were collected from 20 experts representing professions such as public relations, advertising, journalism, and design through a 12-question survey. In the analysis, the F-DEMATEL procedure was initially employed to determine attitudes towards AI technologies, followed by the application of the F-LMAW procedure to assess the magnitude of AI's impact on occupational groups. Findings reveal a nuanced stance: while professionals acknowledge the necessity of AI for their work, they are unwilling to accept unemployment due to more advanced AI. This newly identified structure, termed Post-Luddism, highlights concerns over technological unemployment, particularly pronounced in professions like journalism where job prospects are limited and creative thinking is paramount. In other communication fields, the intensive use of technology mitigates fears of AI harm. However, even in journalism, there exists a propensity to perceive AI as detrimental. These insights shed light on communication professionals' apprehensions and attitudes towards AI's effects. Policymakers and stakeholders can leverage this understanding to formulate strategic measures, considering the divergent perspectives among professional groups regarding AI, towards mitigating potential unemployment risks and fostering AI-adaptive strategies.}

To address this, this study presents the Temporal Convolutional Network-Dual Attention Network-Sparse Transformer (TCN-DANet-Sparse Transformer) model, which considers the spatiotemporal coupling of multiple wind farms. Before detailing our model, we review the existing prediction methods, noting their limitations in capturing interconnected adjacent wind farms. Our model integrates spatial information from nearby farms to enhance prediction reliability. Through Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis, we explore the temporal and spatial coupling features. Using overlapping sliding windows, we partition farms into subsequences, processed with TCN-DANet for efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction. These features are then input into the Sparse Transformer to improve the computational efficiency. Validated using a dataset from Kächele et al., our model outperforms the baseline on the London Wind Farm. In spring, for Case 1, the mean square error (MSE) of the main model decreased by 43.19 % compared to that of the TCN-DANet-transformer model. Similarly, for Case 2, the MSE of the main model is reduced by 41.69 %.}

Effective suicide risk assessments and interventions are vital for suicide prevention. Although assessing such risks is best done by health care professionals, people experiencing suicidal ideation may not seek help. Hence, machine learning (ML) and computational linguistics can provide analytical tools for understanding and analyzing risks. This, therefore, facilitates suicide intervention and prevention.
Objective
This study aims to explore, using statistical analyses and ML, whether computerized language analysis could be applied to assess and better understand a person’s suicide risk on social media.
Methods
We used the University of Maryland Suicidality Dataset comprising text posts written by users (N=866) of mental health–related forums on Reddit. Each user was classified with a suicide risk rating (no, low, moderate, or severe) by either medical experts or crowdsourced annotators, denoting their estimated likelihood of dying by suicide. In language analysis, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon assessed sentiment, thinking styles, and part of speech, whereas readability was explored using the TextStat library. The Mann-Whitney U test identified differences between at-risk (low, moderate, and severe risk) and no-risk users. Meanwhile, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for granular analysis between risk levels and to identify redundancy, respectively. In the ML experiments, gradient boost, random forest, and support vector machine models were trained using 10-fold cross validation. The area under the receiver operator curve and F1-score were the primary measures. Finally, permutation importance uncovered the features that contributed the most to each model’s decision-making.
Results
Statistically significant differences (P<.05) were identified between the at-risk (671/866, 77.5%) and no-risk groups (195/866, 22.5%). This was true for both the crowd- and expert-annotated samples. Overall, at-risk users had higher median values for most variables (authenticity, first-person pronouns, and negation), with a notable exception of clout, which indicated that at-risk users were less likely to engage in social posturing. A high positive correlation (ρ>0.84) was present between the part of speech variables, which implied redundancy and demonstrated the utility of aggregate features. All ML models performed similarly in their area under the curve (0.66-0.68); however, the random forest and gradient boost models were noticeably better in their F1-score (0.65 and 0.62) than the support vector machine (0.52). The features that contributed the most to the ML models were authenticity, clout, and negative emotions.
Conclusions
In summary, our statistical analyses found linguistic features associated with suicide risk, such as social posturing (eg, authenticity and clout), first-person singular pronouns, and negation. This increased our understanding of the behavioral and thought patterns of social media users and provided insights into the mechanisms behind ML models. We also demonstrated the applicative potential of ML in assisting health care professionals to assess and manage individuals experiencing suicide risk.}

After recognizing the issues regarding water, energy and food sectors in the study area and eliciting opinions about nexus interactions, the next stage was to build a conceptual framework to describe the nexus system and to develop an integrated causal loop diagram (CLD) that describes critical system (inter-)linkages. The developed Karawang WEF security (K-WEFS) model is composed of six sub-models with water, energy and food sectors as endogenous factors. In addition, population, economic and ecosystem services were considered as exogenous drivers of the system. It is expected that all the major internal and external factors and drivers are covered, including possible feedback mechanisms, and key variables will be analysed further in the system. The future achievement of WEF security targets can be based on robust evaluation and planning processes underpinned by thorough understanding of whole system dynamics and the impacts of changes in the linked sectors, even in a qualitative way. In this way, a first step towards breaking silo thinking in regional planning may be attained.}

abstract = {There is a general expectation that the laws of classical physics must apply to biology, particularly the neural system. The evoked cycle represents the brain's energy/information exchange with the physical environment through stimulus. Therefore, the thermodynamics of emotions might elucidate the neurological origin of intellectual evolution, and explain the psychological and health consequences of positive and negative emotional states based on their energy profiles. We utilized the Carnot cycle and Landauer's principle to analyze the energetic consequences of the brain's resting and evoked states during and after various cognitive states. Namely, positive emotional states can be represented by the reversed Carnot cycle, whereas negative emotional reactions trigger the Carnot cycle. The two conditions have contrasting energetic and entropic aftereffects with consequences for mental energy. The mathematics of the Carnot and reversed Carnot cycles, which can explain recent findings in human psychology, might be constructive in the scientific endeavor in turning psychology into hard science.}

abstract = {To replace existing high impact ammonia production technologies, a new sustainability-driven waste-based technology producing green ammonia with and without urea was devised using life cycle thinking and sustainable design principles, targeting efficiency, carbon emissions, water, and power use competitiveness. We have used life cycle assessment to determine whether cradle-to-gate, multiple configurations of the core waste-based processes integrating several carbon capture/utilization options can compete environmentally with other available ammonia technologies. Our waste-to-ammonia processes reduce potential impacts from abiotic depletion, human toxicity, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to fossil-based and renewable technologies. Among the assessed technologies, coupling dark fermentation with anaerobic digestion and capturing CO2 for sequestration or later use is most efficient for GHGs, water, and energy, consuming 27% less energy and reducing GHGs by 98% compared to conventional ammonia. Water use is 38% lower than water electrolysis and GHGs are 94% below municipal waste incineration routes per kg NH3. Additionally, displacing conventional, high impact urea by integrating urea production from process CO2 decreases life cycle environmental impacts significantly despite increased energy demand. On a fertilizer-N basis, the ammonia + urea configuration without dark fermentation performs best on all categories included. Methane and ammonia leakage cause nearly all life cycle impacts, indicating that failing to prevent leakage undermines the effectiveness of new technologies such as these. Our results show that a green ammonia/ammonia + urea process family as designed here can reduce waste and prevent the release of additional CO2 from ammonia production while avoiding fossil-based alternatives and decreasing emissions from biogenic waste sources.}

The drilling of the composite specimen is considered and the drilling process parameters such as speed, feed rate, drill diameter, material thickness, and drill point angle are selected. The responses considered in this work are delamination factor, thrust force, and torque. Taguchi analysis is performed and the response table for means for the responses is determined, and the most influencing parameter in the drilling of the composite specimen is analyzed. The grey relational coefficients are computed and followed with the computation of the grey relational grade.

This chapter presents the important themes of embodied cognition. In the chapter, Poirier and others first point out that minds (and brains) have bodies, and that this is not only unlikely to be incidental, but also most of the things that minds can do, they do with their bodies. Pure thinking, that is cognition, seems in and of itself to be a disembodied mental activity, conducted autonomously inside our heads without any signs of sensorimotor interaction with the world of objects, organisms, states, events, and properties that most of our thoughts are about. But surely whatever pure thinking does go on in our heads occurs in the service of our present and future doings in the world, and is grounded in our past doings. Both Proulx and Hélie, and Cangelosi are concerned with how to give a cognitive system the sensorimotor capacity, which is the capacity to detect, recognize and do the kinds of things that one is able to do with the kinds of things there are in the world. In other words, it is the capacity to categorize. The shapes that objects project on one's sensory surfaces can be processed by neural networks that do what is called unsupervised learning.}

The results of the research show: 30.47% of children may access the computer anytime they want; the computer is mostly used for games (36.28%); 42.87% of parents supervise their children's activities at the computer only when they have spare time; 50% of parents allow their children to spend 1-2hours at computer games every day, while 28.54% allow 3-4hours (and more) of computer games every day. The biggest benefits of computer games, according to parents, are thinking development (9.60%), observation capacity (8.27%), and creativity (8.01%). The biggest disadvantages of computer games are the lack of physical movement (13.37%), sight disorders (13.15%) and agitation (8.58%). Parents recognize that games can have powerful effects on children, and should therefore set limits on the amount and content of games their children play. In this way, we can realize the potential benefits while minimizing the potential harms.}

The review found a myriad of definitions of the STEAM concept in general, a variety of interpretations for the “A” in STEAM, and an overall lack of reported learning outcomes in the areas of creativity, problem-solving, and arts education. The articles also differentiate in methods for merging STEAM disciplines, described in one of five ways: transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary, and arts-integration.

These abilities emerge at a similar age and share a common functional anatomy that includes frontal and medial temporal systems that are traditionally associated with planning, episodic memory and default (passive) cognitive states. We speculate that these abilities, most often studied as distinct, rely on a common set of processes by which past experiences are used adaptively to imagine perspectives and events beyond those that emerge from the immediate environment.}

Furthermore, we show that the positive visions of PEWS and RECS are similarly aligned: The concept of participatory sense-making from enactive cognitive science provides an account of why active, dialogical engagement in science communication is so effective. Conversely, processes in which affected communities actively engage developments in science and technology through contribution and contestation provide an invaluable case study for RECS accounts of emergent dynamics in techno-cultural systems. After establishing the connection between PEWS and RECS, we motivate the need for what we call ‘participatory cognitive strategies’. Finally, a brief case study shows the potential for these strategies in actively involving different groups of stakeholders throughout the development of large-scale AI systems, allowing us to make a conceptual contribution to ongoing debates about the meaning of ‘democratizing AI’ in this project and in the larger AI initiative of which it is a part.}

Psychology, like all other sciences, tries to proceed by analysis, by breaking down a living, unique, always developing organic whole into a set of general, already-existing, nameable elements. But as Bakhtin makes clear, in discussing how Dostoevsky portrays the inner dynamics of people worrying over how to act for the best in living their lives, such an itemization of merely observed behavioural characteristics leads to a degrading reification of a person's unfinalizability, of their still-developing nature. Below, I first examine the Cartesianism that still seems present in much of our thinking in social inquiry today. I then turn attention to the primacy of our living movements out in the world and their responsiveness to events occurring around us. While finally turning to the fact that, as living beings, what ‘goes on inside us’, is not so important as ‘what we go on inside of’. Although Dostoevsky portrays this indivisible, flowing reality, in terms of a set of discontinuous fragments —because that is the nature of our experience in everyday life — as hermeneutical-dialogical-relational beings, we have a basic capability of organizing them into unitary wholes which sit in the background to everything we think and do.}

Few studies examine students' use of LLMs as learning tools. This paper focuses on the application of ChatGPT in engineering higher education through an in-depth case study. It investigates whether engineering students can generate high-quality university essays with LLMs assistance, whether existing LLMs identification systems can detect essays produced with LLMs, and how students perceive the usefulness and acceptance of LLMs in learning. The research adopts a deductive/inductive approach, combining conceptualization and empirical evidence analysis. The study involves mechanical and management engineering students, who compose essays using LLMs. The essay assessment showed good results, but some recommendations emerged for teachers and students. Thirteen LLMs detectors were tested without achieving satisfactory results, suggesting to avoid LLMs ban. In addition, students were administered a questionnaire based on constructs and items that follow the technology acceptance models available in the literature. The results contribute to qualitative evidence by highlighting possible future research and educational practices.}

Safety, specifically for collaborative robots, has been mainly addressed from a technical perspective, to safeguard the physical safety of the operator. Concerns have been raised regarding less focus in Industry 4.0 literature on how other factors, such as psychosocial can produce safety-related risks for the operator in human-robot collaboration. This paper identifies and classifies the risk factors in a human-robot collaboration that have been described in research papers in the last decade. The resulting five classes constitute dimensions that will be used as preliminary building blocks for a safety evaluation framework to be developed in the next step. By evaluating the resulting classes with the underlying dimensions of contemporary socio-technical thinking, this paper demonstrates that these five classes offer a comprehensive, system-wide perspective including risk factors beyond technological considerations. Topics emerging from new risks related to the impact of working with collaborative robots, such as psychosocial, ethical, and cyber risk factors will need to be taken into account in the risk factors that are important to identify, assess and mitigate before working with collaborative robots. Operator involvement and participation, especially throughout the risk assessment and mitigation cycle are recommended as new areas of attention in human-robot collaboration. Going forward, one challenge will be the agility and adaptability of legislation to at least keep track of risk factors emerging from continuously changing technologies and to translate them into practically applicable tools for enterprises and design engineers implementing collaborative applications. Another key challenge will be the measurement of the new emerging and sometimes less technological risks.}

This suggests that there must be a different form of computation capable of this sort of calculation.

Changes in neuroendocrine function, particularly the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, contribute to these systems-level behavioral effects. In searching for causal mechanisms underlying these early experience effects, pioneering research has demonstrated an important role for maternal care in offspring development, and this has led to two persistent ideas that permeate current research and thinking: first, environmental impact on the developing infant is mediated through maternal care behavior; second, the more care that a mother provides, the better off her offspring. While a good beginning, the reality is likely more complex. In this review, we critically examine these ideas and propose a computationally-motivated theoretical framework, and within this framework, we consider evidence supporting a hypothesis of maternal modulation.

No single imaging, genomics, or modeling method can provide a complete picture of the process. Beautiful models can sometimes fool our thinking. In this short review, we critically discuss the formation mechanisms of the chromatin domain in the cell from a physical point of view, including phase separation and condensation.}

abstract = {With applications ranging from manufacturing and healthcare to urban planning and energy, digital twin technology has become a ground-breaking idea. In order to provide light on the potential breakthroughs and obstacles that lie ahead, this study examines future trends and research challenges in the field of digital twins. Several significant themes are anticipated to influence the development of digital twins as they continue to change. Digital twins will be better able to learn from complex situations in real time because to the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Digital twins will be given the ability to foresee, improve, and react to dynamic changes as a result of this AI-driven evolution, which will ultimately result in more effective and resilient systems. Another important development is the idea of federated digital twins, in which various interconnected digital twin instances work together to represent a larger, interconnected system. By integrating the strengths of several digital twins, this method makes it easier to model and analyze very complex and interconnected systems, such as smart cities or multimodal transportation networks. It is also projected that digital twins would spread into the Internet of Things (IoT) space. A closer connection between the real and virtual worlds will be made possible by the seamless integration of sensors, actuators, and data streams with digital twin platforms. This pattern will open the door to fresh perspectives and opportunities for improvement. To fully realize the potential of digital twins, a number of scientific challenges must be overcome. As the integration of real-time data from physical systems raises worries about unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities, data privacy and security continue to be of the utmost importance. Additionally, sophisticated methods for data assimilation, model validation, and uncertainty quantification are needed to create accurate and trustworthy digital twin models. Another urgent issue is interoperability. The creation of standardized interfaces and protocols is essential to facilitate seamless integration and data sharing as digital twins proliferate across many sectors and domains. Furthermore, novel approaches to distributed computing and high-performance simulation are necessary to meet the scalability and computational requirements of large-scale digital twin ecosystems. In-depth analysis of these trends and problems is provided in this chapter, along with suggestions for future research areas and solutions. The field of digital twins is set for a paradigm-shifting impact on how we build, function, and interact with the physical world by tackling these issues and exploiting new trends.}

abstract = {Because of the increasing presence of intelligent agents in various aspects of human social life, social skills play a vital role in ensuring these systems exhibit acceptable and realistic behavior in social communication. The importance of emotional intelligence in social capabilities is noteworthy, so incorporating emotions into the behaviors of intelligent agents is essential. Therefore, some computational models of emotions have been presented to develop intelligent agents that exhibit emotional human-like behaviors. However, most current computational models of emotions neglect the dynamic learning of the affective meaning of events based on agents’ experiences. Such models evaluate the events in the environment according to emotional aspects without considering the context of the situations. Also, these models capture the emotional states of agents by using predefined rules determined according to psychological theories. Therefore, they disregard the data-driven methods that can obtain the relationships between appraisal variables and emotions based on natural human data with fewer assumptions on the nature of such relationships. To address these issues, we proposed a novel and unified affective-cognitive framework (EIAEC) to facilitate the development of emotion-aware intelligent agents. EIAEC uses appraisal theories to acquire the emotional states of the agent in various situations. This paper contains four main contributions: 1- We have designed an efficient episodic memory that uses events and their conditional contexts to store and retrieve knowledge and experiences. This memory facilitates emotional expressions and decision-making adapted to the situations of the agent. 2- A novel method has been proposed that learns context-dependent affective values associated with events by using the agent’s experiences in various contexts. Subsequently, we acquired appraisal variables using the elements and related meta-data in episodic memory. 3- We have proposed a new data-driven method that maps appraisal variables to emotional states. 4- Moreover, a method has been developed to update the activation values regarding actions by using the emotional states of the agent. This method models the influence of emotions on the agent’s decision-making. Finally, we simulate a driving scenarios in our proposed framework to manifest the generated emotions in different situations and conditions. Moreover, we show how the proposed method learns the affective meaning of events and actions used in appraisal computing.}

This study applies the fuzzy logic approach for the selection of technology in order to minimize vagueness in decision making, thereby making results more similar to experts’ thinking. Through elicitation of experts’ inputs, six cleaning technologies were evaluated and ranked appropriately, using criteria of technology cost, operating cost, and disposal effect. Moreover, the technology selection was computed through experts’ opinion using the fuzzy logic inference system. The results show that when technical function of the technology is at the low level of 20%, the technology quality is as low as 15%, and the technology flexibility is rated as low at 25%; then the technical adequacy of the assessed technology will be as low as 10%. The fuzzy approach shows that technology performance is largely impacted by criteria far beyond the technology itself, including purchasing cost, disposal cost, operating cost, and other support functions to compliment experience of experts. Despite the fact that decision makers are appropriately selecting technology, the application of the fuzzy logic tool helps to accommodate vagueness, ambiguity, and subjective views of experts. Notwithstanding the robustness of the approach, application of software to help selection of technology is more reliable and accurate, reduce time of decision, and can be accessed worldwide.}

Social interactions routinely lead to neural activity in a “social brain network” comprising, among other regions, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). But what is the function of these areas? Are they specialized for behavior in social contexts or do they implement computations required for dealing with any reactive process, even non-living entities? Here, we use fMRI and a game paradigm separating the need for these two aspects of cognition. We find that most social-brain areas respond to both social and non-social reactivity rather than just to human opponents. However, the TPJ shows a dissociation from the dmPFC: its activity and connectivity primarily reflect context-dependent outcome processing and reactivity detection, while dmPFC engagement is linked to implementation of a behavioral strategy. Our results characterize an overarching computational property of the social brain but also suggest specialized roles for subregions of this network.}

In this study we examined the cognitive and affective responses that political disinformation prompted in Facebook, as the most popular social media platform. Through text analysis of user comments corpora on nearly 2,100 political posts from popular sources in Facebook, we found that compared to true news, political disinformation received significantly less analytic responses from Facebook followers. While the results indicated greater anxiety in responses to true news, responses to political disinformation were filled with greater anger and incivility. We also found similar (low) levels of cognitive thinking in responses to extreme conservative and extreme liberal disinformation. Contrary to prior research findings, our results indicated that responses to extreme liberal disinformation in Facebook were filled with greater anger and incivility. This suggests that the incivility and outrage in online political discourses should not be attributed to a specific political party without considering the concurrent political events.}

Therefore, it is widely studied in distributed robotics research. This paper describes and evaluates a novel transportation scheme for differential-drive mobile robots that is, to the authors’ best knowledge, the most versatile scheme of its kind successfully evaluated with real-world hardware. The proposed scheme can conceptually deal with any number of robots and arbitrary polygonal objects, including non-convex ones, without having to retune, retrain, or reconfigure any of the control parameters between different scenarios. This is achieved by splitting the task into a formation control and a formation finding task, both of which are tackled with model-based approaches using distributed optimization. Formation control and formation finding are complicated by the robots’ non-holonomic kinematic constraints. Therefore, a tailored distributed model predictive controller is used for formation control. Finding formations relies on a multibody-dynamics representation of the robots-object system to properly account for contact and non-holonomic constraints. Due to these measures, the transportation scheme achieves a very satisfactory performance and dexterity in real-world hardware experiments utilizing network communication and distributed computation.}

Vitamin E acetate, likely added as a diluent to cannabis-containing products, was linked to EVALI. Literature searches were performed on vitamin E and vitamin E acetate-associated neurotoxicity. Blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration potential of vitamin E and vitamin E acetate were evaluated using cheminformatic techniques. Review of the literature showed that the neurotoxic potential of inhalation exposures to these compounds in humans is unknown. Physico-chemical properties demonstrate these compounds are lipophilic, and molecular weights indicate vitamin E and vitamin E acetate have the potential for BBB permeability. Computational models also predict both compounds may cross the BBB via passive diffusion. Based on literature search, no experimental nonclinical studies and clinical information on the neurotoxic potential of vitamin E via inhalation. Neurotoxic effects from pyrolysis by-product, phenyl acetate, structurally analogous to vitamin E acetate, suggests vitamin E acetate has potential for central nervous system (CNS) impairment. Cheminformatic model predictions provide a theoretical basis for potential CNS permeability of these inhaled dietary ingredients suggesting prioritization to evaluate for potential hazard to the CNS.}

In Study 1, judgments were affected by rated agreement with moral rules proscribing harm, whether the dilemma under consideration made moral rules versus consequences of choice salient, and by thinking styles (intuitive vs. deliberative). In Studies 2 and 3, participants evaluated policy decisions to knowingly do harm to a resource to mitigate greater harm or to merely allow the greater harm to happen. When evaluated in isolation, approval for decisions to harm was affected by endorsement of moral rules and by thinking style. When both choices were evaluated simultaneously, total harm – but not the do/allow distinction – influenced rated approval. These studies suggest that moral rules play an important, but context-sensitive role in moral cognition, and offer an account of when emotional reactions to perceived moral violations receive less weight than consideration of costs and benefits in moral judgment and decision making.}

Structural neuroimaging studies have identified a combination of shared and disorder-specific patterns of gray matter (GM) deficits across psychiatric disorders. Pooling large data allows for examination of a possible common neuroanatomical basis that may identify a certain vulnerability for mental illness. Large-scale collaborative research is already facilitated by data repositories, institutionally supported databases, and data archives. However, these data-sharing methodologies can suffer from significant barriers. Federated approaches augment these approaches by enabling access or more sophisticated, shareable and scaled-up analyses of large-scale data. We examined GM alterations using Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation, an open-source, decentralized analysis application. Through federated analysis of eight sites, we identified significant overlap in the GM patterns (n = 4,102) of individuals with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

It will be interesting to discuss the temperature inside the house as one of the comfort factors. The study aims to analyze the temperature conditions inside the house, which are influenced by the slope of the roof. A two-dimensional unsteady state heat equation represents this temperature since the temperature distribution satisfies the heat transfer concept and changes over time. This governing equation will be approximated by the forward time center space scheme as one finite difference method and completed by the quadratic ghost point method since the house domain is an irregular shape. Van Neumann criteria are applied here to analyze the stability of the computational approach for this numerical scheme. Furthermore, these schemes are implemented in MATLAB application to quantitatively and visually display temperature dynamics. Some simulations completed these approximations to see temperature variations over time. The results show that the bigger slope causes the average temperature to be cooler. In other words, the temperature in the house will be more comfortable when the roof slope gets bigger.}

The implementation of the technique has totally eliminated the costly multiplications of large Boolean matrices, where intensive cpu utilization was required. The overall expensive computer time has been drastically reduced, particularly for the three-dimensional systems involving large degrees of freedom, as a result of their intricate geometry. The algorithmic procedure has been presented in a matrix form and is based on the recursive formulation using Kane's equation, strain energy, mode synthesis, finite element approach, a stable and efficient method for reducing the number of equations subsequent to the constraints resulting from closed loops and/or prescribed motions. Further enhancement in the speed of execution has been achieved by subjecting the developed code to vectorization on the vector-processing machine. A study of simple robot with flexible links has been presented comparing the execution times on the scalar machine (IBM-3081) and the vector-processor (IBM-3090) with and without vector options.

This chapter examines an approach that integrates neural computation and rule-based reasoning, or the hybrid systems. This integration is actively applied in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences, such as linguistic theory, natural language processing, and expert systems. The opportunity of employing neural techniques in expert systems is often suggested on the ground that the learning, generalization, fault, and noise tolerance capacities of neural networks can alleviate well-known shortcomings of symbolic problem solvers, such as brittleness in front of incomplete or noisy data, no increase in performance with experience, and time-consuming knowledge acquisition. This chapter explores neurosymbolic integration for rule-based expert systems in connection with automatic data acquisition, rule processing, and explanation. At the periphery of expert systems, sensory processing by neural nets is coupled to rule-based reasoning in order to perform a data acquisition task involving the deployment of expert knowledge and heuristic problem solving. The reaction times of rule-based systems are dramatically reduced by the use of a neurally inspired, parallel inference engine. Informative user interactions with expert systems are achieved by coupling symbolic and neurally supported, pictorial explanation. The relative significance of these aspects of neurosymbolic integration is enhanced by pointing to limitations of neural techniques for automatic knowledge acquisition and robust problem solving in expert systems. These uses of neural nets may often jeopardize an expert system's reliability and reduce its transparency to the user.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter describes the early, formative stages of a theory of hippocampal function. This theory has been stimulated by the psychological observations indicating a role for the hippocampus in short-term working memory and spatial behavior and develops mainly through the consideration of computational issues. These computational issues are related to the psychological viewpoint through physiological and anatomical observations. The hippocampus participates in the prediction of future representations based on past and present representations. All three classes of representations are derived from a multiplicity of sensory modalities, such as auditory, visual, and olfactory signals from neo- and piriform cortices. This fusion of sensory modalities requires recoding because of computational complexity problems. The CA1 region of the hippocampus is postulated to be a prediction-generating layer or tier. This region produces a prediction based on its input from hippocampal region CA3. The combined hippocampal dentate gyrus/CA3 (DG/CA3) system is postulated to be a preprocessor serving the CA1 prediction layer. The computational complexity problems arise from the combinatorial explosion of possible representations resulting when the hippocampus and supporting limbic structures mix representations from multiple sensory modalities.}

Emerging parametric models facilitate design space exploration based on quantifiable performance metrics, yet remain time-consuming and computationally expensive, leaving room for improvement. This paper provides a design exploration and explanation framework to augment the designer via a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which serves as a forward performance predictor as well as an inverse design generator conditioned on a set of performance requests. Hence, the CVAE overcomes the limitations of traditional iterative techniques by learning a differentiable mapping for a highly nonlinear design space, thus enabling sensitivity analysis. These methods allow for informing designers about (i) relations of the model between features and performances and (ii) structural improvements under user-defined objectives. The framework is tested on a case-study and proves its potential to serve as a future co-pilot for conceptual design studies of diverse civil structures and beyond.}

We then examine two questions: whether social cognition entails characteristic concepts and cognitive processes, and how social processes might themselves shape and constrain cognition. We suggest that social cognition relies heavily on generic cognition but also on unique concepts (e.g., agent, intentionality) and unique processes (e.g., projection, imitation, joint attention). We further suggest that social processes play a prominent role in the development and unfolding of several generic cognitive processes, including learning, attention, and memory. Finally, we comment on the prospects of a recently developing approach to the study of social cognition (social neuroscience) and two potential future directions (computational social cognition and social–cognitive robotics).}

This proposal is examined via a classical trajectory computation using a number of model potentials in which the degrees of freedom which do not take part in the net reaction are, or are not, frozen. The models include a full six-atom potential. The essential features of the dynamics are not sensitive to the level of detail with which the CH3 is described, showing that the intramolecular dynamics of the radical do not significantly affect the dynamics of the reactive event. The reaction is found to proceed by two distinct mechanisms: for trajectories with a large impact parameter, a very short lived complex is formed and dissociates to a rotationally cold HCl product, scattered into the forward direction. At smaller impact parameters, the reaction proceeds via a direct mechanism with a rotationally hot HCl which is scattered backward. The computed angular distribution is in agreement with the experiment, which detects HCl in the j = 1, 3 states and suggests that higher rotational states of HCl, which were not probed in the experiment, will also be scattered backward. The role of the initial vibrational excitation of CH4 is discussed.}

abstract = {Active Noise Control (ANC) systems play a crucial role in reducing unwanted noise in various settings. Traditional ANC methods, like the Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (FxLMS) algorithm, are effective in linear noise scenarios. However, they often struggle with more nonlinear and complex noise patterns. This paper introduces a novel approach using the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm in nonlinear ANC systems, which represents a significant departure from conventional techniques. The BSO algorithm, inspired by human brainstorming processes, excels in addressing the complexities of nonlinear noise by incorporating principles, such as delayed evaluation, free imagination, quantity and quality, and comprehensive improvement. By combining the BSO algorithm with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a new ANC system is proposed that can adapt to a wide range of noise types with improved speed and accuracy. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of the BSO algorithm, achieving an impressive noise reduction of up to 48 dB (dB) in a 500Hz sinusoidal noise scenario, with a convergence time as fast as 0.01 s, outperforming the FxLMS algorithm by a significant margin. Moreover, in complex environments with multi-frequency and random noise, the BSO algorithm consistently demonstrates better noise reduction and quicker convergence, reducing noise levels by up to 27 dB within 0.001 s. The innovative use of the BSO algorithm in ANC systems not only enhances noise reduction capabilities, especially for nonlinear and complex noise signals, but also improves convergence times, paving the way for future advancements in ANC technologies.}

However, one has to face with the rule explosion in these applications. To deal with this problem, hierarchical fuzzy systems with the compositional rule of inference (CRI) method have been constructed by a series of low-dimensional sub fuzzy systems. And it has been proved that hierarchical fuzzy inference method can efficiently restrain the explosion of fuzzy rules. Therefore, in order to increase the computational efficiency of the fuzzy inference based on the BKS when multi-input-single-output (MISO) fuzzy rules are involved, this paper mainly constructs two hierarchical fuzzy inference methods based on the BKS in which the if-then rules are respectively interpreted by fuzzy implications and ML-implications. Moreover, the validity of the two BKS hierarchical fuzzy inferences is studied with the GMP rules. Finally, two examples are employed to illustrate the computational efficiency of our proposed BKS hierarchical inference methods.}

The problem is that naturalistic human interaction must integrate all of these factors simultaneously, and grander theoretical mitigation cannot come only from focused experimental or computational agendas. We look to dynamical systems theory as a framework for thinking about how these multiple behaviors, processes, and contexts can be integrated into a broader account of human interaction. By introducing and utilizing basic concepts of self-organization and synergy, we review empirical work that shows how human interaction is flexible and adaptive and structures itself incrementally during unfolding interactive tasks, such as conversation, or more focused goal-based contexts. We end on acknowledging that dynamical systems accounts are very short on concrete models, and we briefly describe ways that theoretical frameworks could be integrated, rather than endlessly disputed, to achieve some success on the centipede’s dilemma of human interaction.}

However, the safety-EMPC control strategy was developed with a centralized economic model predictive control (EMPC) structure; thus, computation time limitations within a sampling period may reduce the effectiveness of such a controller design for promoting process safety. Alternatively, we develop in this work sequential and iterative safety-based distributed EMPC schemes (safety-DEMPC) that may overcome the computation time limitations of the centralized safety-EMPC while maintaining similar closed-loop performance. Using a catalytic reactor example, the two proposed safety-DEMPC schemes were demonstrated to achieve similar closed-loop performance to the centralized safety-EMPC while reducing the on-line computation time requirements compared to the centralized safety-EMPC.}

In addition, variation in the appearance of mitotic figures causes a high degree of discordance among pathologists. With advances in deep learning models, several automatic mitosis detection algorithms have been proposed but they are sensitive to domain shift often seen in histology images. We propose a robust and efficient two-stage mitosis detection framework, which comprises mitosis candidate segmentation (Detecting Fast) and candidate refinement (Detecting Slow) stages. The proposed candidate segmentation model, termed EUNet, is fast and accurate due to its architectural design. EUNet can precisely segment candidates at a lower resolution to considerably speed up candidate detection. Candidates are then refined using a deeper classifier network, EfficientNet-B7, in the second stage. We make sure both stages are robust against domain shift by incorporating domain generalization methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and generalizability of the proposed model on the three largest publicly available mitosis datasets, winning the two mitosis domain generalization challenge contests (MIDOG21 and MIDOG22). Finally, we showcase the utility of the proposed algorithm by processing the TCGA breast cancer cohort (1,124 whole-slide images) to generate and release a repository of more than 620K potential mitotic figures (not exhaustively validated).}

Meanwhile, we have conducted in-depth comparative analysis of the two methods, which concluded that the accuracy of DeePMD model performs better and time efficiency of KRR model has more advantages.

In the case devices are found to be prone to parametric resonance, it typically has a negative impact on power harvesting and may jeopardize the reliability of the device. This paper makes the case that parametric resonance is not a danger that should be avoided, but rather a chance to achieve a broader system response bandwidth and ultimately increase the amount of power available at the power take-off. Since a time-varying wetted surface causes the highly nonlinear phenomenon of parametric resonance, linear models are unable to fully capture this instability. As a result, nonlinear Froude–Krylov forces are herein implemented via a computationally effective method for prismatic floaters that is compatible with both exhaustive simulation methods and real-time computing, as the whole simulations runs up to 50 times faster than real-time. A novel pendulum-based device is intentionally defined to exhibit a 2:1 ratio between heave and pitch natural frequencies, causing parametric instability. Results demonstrate that linear models predict a single zone of meaningful potential power extraction around the pitch natural frequency, as expected; however, by using the designed attitude to develop parametric instability, a second additional region develops near the heave natural period. As a result, the free response bandwidth is in fact increased, making more energy available at the power take-off axis thanks to the nonlinear instability embedded in the wave energy converter.}

abstract = {Purpose
The national mathematics curriculum of Pakistan has emphasized on improving content knowledge, reasoning abilities and problem-solving skills of students about thinking, communicating and solving mathematics (national mathematics curriculum of Pakistan, 2006). Whereas, there is a need to understand the point of view of teachers about the challenges they face in achieving the goals of national mathematics curriculum. This will help leading teacher training institutions to revisit their math teacher continuous professional development (CPD) programs and facilitate school leadership in improving the quality of math education in rural schools of the province. However, the purpose of this research study is to figure out the challenges that teachers are facing while achieving the goals of the national curriculum by teaching mathematics at the primary level in educational institutes of Pakistan.
Design/methodology/approach
In this research study qualitative research approaches have been utilized, in which focus group discussions (FGDs) were used as data collection techniques. Furthermore, thematic analysis of the data led toward the development of four overarching themes such as teachers' knowledge about mathematics curriculum, challenges relating to mathematics content and pedagogy, difficulties in developing conceptual understanding and designing lesson plans to address students' diversity.
Findings
The overall findings of this research study suggested that the majority of teachers are facing difficulties in mathematics content teaching such as decimal fraction, unitary method, measurement principles, practical geometry and data handling. Moreover, teachers are also facing challenges and difficulties in developing hands-on and minds-on activities in the teaching of mathematical concepts to the students of primary level in educational institutes of Pakistan.
Practical implications
This research study will facilitate the teachers and stakeholders to address the problematic issues in the domain of content delivery of mathematics. Whereas, this study recommends educating teachers about national mathematics curriculum and to develop a CPD framework for mathematics teachers for the enhancement of their pedagogical content knowledge. The study also recommends orientating school heads about the different aspects of math curriculum so that they can mentor math teachers in achieving math curriculum goals.
Originality/value
This is the first research study of its nature, which targets and highlights the teacher's perceptions toward the achieving the goals of national mathematics curriculum of Pakistan and addressing the pedagogical challenges faced in mathematics teachers. There is a dearth of studies in mathematics education in Sindh province. The issue is of immense importance, the findings will help teachers to improve mathematics instructions at primary level.}

abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) efficiently processes large datasets, showing promise in enhancing clinical practice within physical therapy.
Objective
The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of studies using ML approaches in clinical settings of physical therapy.
Data sources
A scoping review was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus.
Selection criteria
We included studies utilizing ML methods. ML was defined as the utilization of computational systems to encode patterns and relationships, enabling predictions or classifications with minimal human interference.
Data extraction and data synthesis
Data were extracted regarding methods, data types, performance metrics, and model availability.
Results
Forty-two studies were included. The majority were published after 2020 (n = 25). Fourteen studies (33.3%) were in the musculoskeletal physical therapy field, nine (21.4%) in neurological, and eight (19%) in sports physical therapy. We identified 44 different ML models, with random forest being the most used. Three studies reported on model availability. We identified several clinical applications for ML-based tools, including diagnosis (n = 14), prognosis (n = 7), treatment outcomes prediction (n = 7), clinical decision support (n = 5), movement analysis (n = 4), patient monitoring (n = 3), and personalized care plan (n = 2).
Limitation
Model performance metrics, costs, model interpretability, and explainability were not reported.
Conclusion
This scope review mapped the emerging landscape of machine learning applications in physical therapy. Despite the growing interest, the field still lacks high-quality studies on validation, model availability, and acceptability to advance from research to clinical practice.}

They promise the capacity to analyze vast amounts of more precise and real-time data, improving how decision-makers predict, respond, and adapt. Yet scholars in political ecology have long observed that technocentric approaches typically reduce complex human-environment relationships in ways that fail to account for social relations and power dynamics. This paper charts the emerging political economy of “climate AI” – the philanthropies, NGOs, private consultancies, and tech giants investing in data-driven climate initiatives. Mapping out two case studies, we show that environmental and climate crises are grist for tech solutions and find that many climate AI actors are interested in it for surveillance, greenwashing, and commodifying algorithms. We pay special attention to how neocolonial and racialized power structures manifest in climate AI and outline three ways for political ecologists and digital geographers to research its socio-materiality: how computational resources are environmentally embedded, how disasters become “shocks” that the AI industry capitalizes on, and how climate AI shapes material investment flows and landscapes. Highlighting how data-driven approaches to climate crises reproduce injustices already faced by marginalized communities, our analysis contributes to research on environmental data justice.}

What is consciousness? Most contemporary analytic philosophers attempt to answer these questions within a broadly materialistic framework since they think that there is overwhelming reason to believe that human beings are biological organisms entirely composed of ordinary matter. Recently the central questions in the philosophy of mind have been given some new twists and partial answers by developments within cognitive science. This article reviews some of the main ideas in cognitive science and its impact on these issues in the philosophy of mind.}

abstract = {Self-injury and suicide can be characterized by reward system dysfunction and self-reports of active efforts to escape unpleasant emotional states. Therefore, individuals with histories of suicidal ideation (SI) should exhibit a preference for active escape from unpleasant states, which exceed the effects of impulsive behavior under distress and lack of premeditation. Participants made active (Go) or passive (No-Go) choices in response to stimuli to escape or avoid an unpleasant state in a behavioral task. A drift-diffusion reinforcement learning model was used to estimate latent biases for active escape and avoidance in people with and without SI history. Bayesian logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between escape and avoid bias with SI. Escape bias predicted SI history, whereas avoidance bias did not. Escape bias remained a significant predictor of SI when controlling for negative urgency and lack of premeditation. Those with histories of SI demonstrate a decision-making bias favoring escape from aversive states. This bias remains significant after adjusting for facets of impulsivity linked to hasty decisions under distress and lack of premeditation. A heightened escape response may help clinicians to identify SI risk and develop targeted treatments to attenuate the escape bias.}

If CCS is expected to be adopted globally, transparent and reliable data and information must be readily attainable to all stakeholders to support the technology choice and decision-making process. The implementation of CCS requires effective communication and collaboration strategies. Still, materials and communication platforms to inform stakeholders about the potential and contribution of CCS are predominantly accessible in English since ongoing projects are mainly located in English-speaking countries. The Mexican Carbon Capture and Storage platform (MeCCS) was developed as a digital sharing and learning space for national stakeholders to obtain and expand their knowledge about CCS technology in Spanish. It was constructed as a boundary object (BO) to bridge different communities and disciplines, facilitating communication, understanding, and cooperation. The platform includes diverse elements that combine science and art to produce dissemination materials for different audiences to help build critical thinking and inform them about CCS technology. The platform confirmed its capacity to transfer and translate knowledge one year after its launch. It also served to connect different audiences in Mexico and globally and identify further areas of research and CCS-related efforts.}

abstract = {The concept of sustainable development has impacted in analytical chemistry changing the way of thinking processes and methods. It is important for analytical chemists to consider how sample preparation can integrate the basic concepts of Green Chemistry. In this sense, the replacement of traditional organic solvents is of utmost importance. Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) have come to light as a green alternative. In the last few years, a growing number of contributions have applied these natural solvents proving their efficiency in terms of extraction ability, analyte stabilization capacity and detection compatibility. However, the arising question that has to be answered is: the use of NADES is enough to green an extraction process? This review presents an overview of knowledge regarding sustainability of NADES-based extraction procedures, focused on reported literature within the timeframe spanning from 2011 up to date. The contributions were analyzed from a green perspective in terms of energy, time, sample and solvent consumption. Moreover, we include a critical analysis to clarify whether the use of NADES as extraction media is enough for greening an analytical methodology; strategies to make them even greener are also presented. Finally, recent trends and future perspectives on how NADES-based extraction approaches in combination with computational methodologies can contribute are discussed.}

This paper will argue that, despite advances in computation and software, they remain difficult to model. The main reason for this is the shortage of ideas on what is the real objective of FE modelling for such processes. Even a very detailed model and data obtained in simulation does not give answers to the main question - how to optimise the process parameters? High computational time and volume of information only aggravate the situation. All modern mathematical techniques of dimensionality reduction (such as POD/PGD) lose their power when the priorities and acceptable compromises of modelling are not clear. This paper tries to use a large volume of available experimental and modelling experience to illustrate this problem and look for possible break-through directions.}

The complex properties of such systems make modelling an indispensable tool for their description and analysis. Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.}
