abstract = {The principle of homology-continuity in Multi-Dimensional Biomimetic Informatics Space is applied to construct the identifying mechanism of category of deep representation of mental imagery. The model of each cerebral region involved in recognizing is established respectively and a feedforward method for establishing category mental imagery is proposed. First, the model of feature acquisition is developed based on Hubel-Wiesel model, and Gaussian function is used to simulate the simple cell receptive field to satisfy the specific function of visual cortex. Second, multiple input aggregation operation is employed to simulate the feature output of complex cells to get the invariance representation in feature space. Then, imagery basis is extracted by unsupervised learning algorithm based on the primary feature and category mental imagery is obtained by building Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. Finally, the system model is tested by training set and test set composed of real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can establish valid deep representation of these samples, based on which the biomimetic construction of category mental imagery can be achieved. This method provides a new idea for solving imagery problem and studying imagery thinking.}

Within this model, not only is caring not a prerequisite of urban production, but decade(s)in of smartification and platformization practices shows diminishing the spaces, infrastructure, and socio-economic relations that were co-produced to generate care. Through the lens of feminist geography, care is examined as a multidimensional concept encompassing socio-spatial dynamics, power relations, and ethical urban practices. Using empirical data from three research projects, the study showcases alternative digital urbanism practices, categorized into three vignettes: refusal, commoning, and reappropriation. These categories are illustrated with cases such as grassroots food cooperatives, feminist hack-spaces, digital sovereignty initiatives, platform-based welfare experiments and civil society initiatives such as Code for Germany. By situating care within the spatial and social fabric of urban life, the paper argues for its potential as a politic, practice, and epistemology that challenges the exploitative logic of contemporary digital infrastructures. The findings reveal the embeddedness of care practices within local contexts, highlighting the dual need for trans-local networks and territorial embeddedness. This study contributes to the discourse on caring digital urbanism, advancing a feminist theorisation of everyday digital urbanism.}

abstract = {Ellipse detection techniques are often developed and validated in software environments, neglecting the critical consideration of computational efficiency and resource constraints prevalent in embedded systems. Furthermore, programmable logic devices, notably Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), have emerged as indispensable assets for enhancing performance and expediting various processing applications. In the realm of computational efficiency, hardware implementations have the flexibility to tailor the required arithmetic for various applications using fixed-point representation. This approach enables faster computations while upholding adequate accuracy, resulting in reduced resource and energy consumption compared to software applications that rely on higher clock speeds, which often lead to increased resource and energy consumption. Additionally, hardware solutions provide portability and are suitable for resource-constrained and battery-powered applications. This study introduces a novel hardware architecture in the form of an intellectual property core that harnesses the capabilities of a genetic algorithm to detect single and multi ellipses in digital images. In general, genetic algorithms have been demonstrated to be an alternative that shows better results than those based on traditional methods such as the Hough Transform and Random Sample Consensus, particularly in terms of accuracy, flexibility, and robustness. Our genetic algorithm randomly takes five edge points as parameters from the image tested, creating an individual treated as a potential candidate ellipse. The fitness evaluation function determines whether the candidate ellipse truly exists in the image space. The core is designed using Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS), a powerful tool that converts C or C＋＋functions into Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code, including VHDL and Verilog. The implementation and testing of the ellipse detection system were carried out on the PYNQ-Z1, a cost-effective development board housing the Xilinx Zynq-7000 System-on-Chip (SoC). PYNQ, an open-source framework, seamlessly integrates programmable logic with a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor, offering the flexibility of Python programming for the onboard SoC processor. The experimental results, based on synthetic and real images, some of them with the presence of noise processed by the developed ellipse detection system, highlight the intellectual property core’s exceptional suitability for resource-constrained embedded systems. Notably, it achieves remarkable performance and accuracy rates, consistently exceeding 99% in most cases. This research aims to contribute to the advancement of hardware-accelerated ellipse detection, catering to the demanding requirements of real-time applications while minimizing resource consumption.}

The mQNN organizes input information using quantum images and trainable quantum parameters encoded in superposition states. Leveraging quantum parallelism, the model efficiently processes inner product calculations of quantum neurons via the swap test, achieving constant complexity. To enhance the expressive capacity of the mQNN, nonlinear transformations, specifically quantum versions of activation functions, are integrated into the quantum network. The mQNN’s circuits are constructed from flexible quantum modules, allowing the model to adapt its structure based on varying input data types and scales for optimal performance. Furthermore, rigorous mathematical derivations are employed to validate the quantum state evolution during computation within a quantum neuron. Testing on the Pennylane platform simulates the quantum environment and confirms the mQNN’s effectiveness on the MNIST dataset. These findings highlight the potential of quantum computing in advancing image classification tasks.}

The escort function as a coefficient to distort the decision-making determines the behavior of solutions to the ERD, whereas its investigations are still not sufficient. Particularly, the ERD was investigated in finite-action settings in the previous studies, while that with a continuum of actions has not been studied well. In this paper, we formulate and analyze the ERD with a continuum of actions represented by a bounded interval. Our ERD is a partial integro-differential equation whose well-posedness is nontrivial because of specific nonlocal terms arising from the escort function. The Kaniadakis escort function is chosen as a major example of the escort function, with which we obtain the unique existence of solutions to the ERD. We also discuss cases with the other escort functions, such as the power and constant ones, and suggest that the growth and regularity behaviors of the escort function are crucial. Finally, we computationally apply the ERD to problems related to sustainable environmental and resource management.}

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of cognitive decline. The alarming epidemiological features of Alzheimer's disease, combined with the high failure rate of candidate drugs tested in the preclinical phase, impose more intense investigations for new curative treatments. NRF2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2) plays a critical role in the inflammatory response and in the cellular redox homeostasis and provides cytoprotection in several diseases including those in the neurodegeneration spectrum. These roles suggest that NRF2 and its directly associated proteins may be novel attractive therapeutic targets in the fight against AD. In this study, through a systemics perspective, we propose an in silico drug repurposing approach for AD, based on the NRF2 interactome and regulome, with the aim of highlighting possible repurposed drugs for AD. Using publicly available information based on differential expressions of the NRF2-neighborhood in AD and through a computational drug repurposing pipeline, we derived to a short list of candidate repurposed drugs and small molecules that affect the expression levels of the majority of NRF2-partners. The relevance of these findings was assessed in a four-step computational meta-analysis including i) structural similarity comparisons with currently ongoing NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials ii) evaluation based on the NRF2-diseasome iii) comparison of relevance between targeted pathways of shortlisted drugs and NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials and iv) further comparison with existing knowledge on AD and NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials based on their known modes of action. Overall, our analysis yielded in 5 candidate repurposed drugs for AD. In cell culture, these 5 candidates activated a luciferase reporter for NRF2 activity and in hippocampus derived TH22 cells they increased NRF2 protein levels and the NRF2 transcriptional signatures as determined by increased expression of its downstream target heme oxygenase 1. We expect that our proposed candidate repurposed drugs will be useful for further research and clinical translation for AD.}

We argue that such differentiation cannot be achieved with conventional Building Information Modelling and without customizing existing software. We compare the case studies' PD approaches (objected-oriented programming, functional programming, visual programming and distributed visual programming) and decomposition, algorithms and data structures as crucial factors for the practical viability of complex parametric models and as key aspects of PD thinking.}

Propositional list structures are used to represent verbal information and reasoning. Small individual pieces from the different representations are linked on a sequential and temporary basis to form a reasoning and inferencing chain, using visually encoded information recalled to the Mind's Eye from long-term memory and from cues recognized on an external display. CaMeRa, like the expert, uses the diagrammatic and verbal representations to complement one another, thus exploiting the unique advantages of each.}

Exploratory modelling, and specifically Robust Decision Making (RDM), are potential approaches capable of addressing these challenges: by exploring a wide range of conceivable futures, they explicitly embrace deep uncertainties while seeking to reduce system vulnerabilities. However, though RDM methods have been well documented, there is little insight as to how such approach might be integrated into Net-Zero policy design processes. By means of a workshop (n=17) and interviews (n=13) with the UK climate policy and energy modelling communities, this contribution provides insights into the role and potential of RDM in explicitly dealing with the deep uncertainties that pervade in the establishment of a 60–100 MtCO2 UK GGR sector within three decades. The consultation process revealed that there is an appetite from the decision-making and analytical communities in integrating exploratory modelling concepts into UK policy design processes. It is recommended that to bridge the gap between theoretical RDM constructs and their broader adoption, the analytical process should include a broader set of disciplines and expertise. Specifically for the modelling community, this work suggests that in-use computational models should be adapted, rather than new tools developed. Key challenges also arise from the time and resources required, suggesting small scale place-based pilots could promote the acceptability and foster the adoption of the RDM methodology.}

Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML), an evidence-based debriefing method, promotes thinking like a nurse through reflective learning. Despite widespread adoption of DML, little is known about how well it is implemented. To assess the effectiveness of DML implementation, an evaluative rubric was developed and tested.
Sample
Three debriefers who had been trained to use DML at least 1 year previously, submitted five recorded debriefings each for evaluation.
Methods
Three raters who were experts in DML scored each of the 15 recorded debriefing session using DML Evaluation Scale (DMLES). Observable behaviors were scored with binary options. These raters also assessed the items in the DMLES for content validity.
Results

Conclusion
Use of DMLES could support quality improvement, teacher preparation, and faculty development. Future testing is warranted to investigate the relationship between DML implementation and clinical reasoning.}

abstract = {As data-driven prediction models advance, an increasing number of people are enjoying news personalized to their interests. The primary problem such recommendation models solve is to precisely match information with users and, in so doing, ensure that news spreads with greater efficiency. However, these techniques only help the media platform; they do not help those who produce the news. Hence, we devised a propagation framework based on a human-in-the-loop simulation that helps content authors maximize the spread of their messages through social networks. The framework works by acting on feedback provided by the simulation model. Additionally, the spread of information is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem in which propagation is data-driven and simulated with machine learning techniques that leverage data on the historical behaviors of users. We additionally describe an implementation for this framework as an example of how the framework might be used in real life. On the practical side, the implementation uses text data from a blog to simulate the message's propagation, while, from a technical point of view, the multi-objective optimization problem is divided into an information retrieval problem and an integer programming problem, the results of which are fed back into the content editor as content operation strategies. A case study with the Sina Weibo microblog site not only validates the framework but also provides practitioners with insights into how to maximize the spread of information through social networking platforms. The results show that the proposed propagation framework is capable of increasing retweets by 7.9575 %. As an interesting aside, our experiments also show that the Weibo retweet lottery is both popular and a highly effective mechanism for increasing reposts.}

Geographers have studied cybersecurity as collectively constituted through a complex mixture of technologies, materialities, cultures, knowledges. In so doing, they have probed a range of phenomena crucial to cybersecurity; from technical processes such as encryption, malware infection, and threat detection, to the social arrangements and negotiations between various organizations and states, the implications of surveillance and big data on privacy, and how threats affect various infrastructure that support ways of life across the globe. Nevertheless, geographers do not simply consider cybersecurity as a mode of security imposed “online” or through digital technologies.

Software engineering research aims to establish software development practice on a scientific basis. However, the evidence of the efficacy of technology is insufficient to ensure its uptake in industry. In the absence of a theoretical frame of reference, we mainly rely on best practices and expert judgment from industry-academia collaboration and software process improvement research to improve the acceptance of the proposed technology.
Objective:
To identify acceptance models and theories and discuss their applicability in the research of acceptance behavior related to software development.
Method:
We analyzed literature reviews within an interdisciplinary team to identify models and theories relevant to software engineering research. We further discuss acceptance behavior from the human information processing perspective of automatic and affect-driven processes (“fast” system 1 thinking) and rational and rule-governed processes (“slow” system 2 thinking).
Results:
We identified 30 potentially relevant models and theories. Several of them have been used in researching acceptance behavior in contexts related to software development, but few have been validated in such contexts. They use constructs that capture aspects of (automatic) system 1 and (rational) system 2 oriented processes. However, their operationalizations focus on system 2 oriented processes indicating a rational view of behavior, thus overlooking important psychological processes underpinning behavior.
Conclusions:
Software engineering research may use acceptance behavior models and theories more extensively to understand and predict practice adoption in the industry. Such theoretical foundations will help improve the impact of software engineering research. However, more consideration should be given to their validation, overlap, construct operationalization, and employed data collection mechanisms when using these models and theories.}

Therefore, understanding the link between neurons and behaviour is a multi-level problem, which can be achieved when considering Marr’s three levels of understanding: behaviour, computation, and neural implementation. Rather than establishing direct links between neurons and behaviour, the matter boils down to understanding two transitions: the link between neurons and brain computation on one hand, and the link between brain computations and behaviour on the other hand. The field of insect navigation illustrates well the power of such two-sided endeavour. We provide here examples revealing that each transition requires its own approach with its own intrinsic difficulties, and show how modelling can help us reach the desired multi-level understanding.}

To promote a more student-centered approach, active-based learning, and improved assessment strategies, the Brazilian government approved the so-called New National Curriculum Guidelines (NCG) for engineering courses. To comply with those guidelines, the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (USP) is currently developing an educational modernization process sponsored by the Fulbright Commission in Brazil, called Special Program for Modernization of Undergraduate Education (PMG). The project is based on three pillars of modernization: content (what), form (how), and infrastructure (where). This paper describes initiatives in each of those pillars: content and format changes in Chemical Reaction Engineering and Process Safety courses and the creation of new spaces for a student-centered approach (an innovative classroom layout and a makerspace). By gathering two concrete classroom experiences guided by a broader institutional educational policies (the PMG project and the NCG), this paper highlights that slight changes can lead to great improvements in the learning process, leading to more engagement in the development of hard skills while favoring improvements in soft skills, such as communication, team-based work, and critical thinking.}

We fitted latent growth curve models separately for the development of frequency and distress of symptoms. CBT was significantly more successful than counselling in reducing delusional frequency in the short term and hallucinatory distress at any point, even in those with relatively high thought disorder. We found little evidence that clinicians should restrict CBT in this subgroup of patients. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the importance of effective initial treatment of thought disorder in maximising the benefit of CBT for psychosis, particularly for reducing distress from hallucinations.}

In this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program. Experiments were conducted with 47 second-year elementary school students, and students’ responses were better in the AI-based convergence education program than in general subject classes in terms of interest, understanding, and expectations for classes.}

When exhibiting the first type of sketching behavior, designers are able to transform their original sketches to satisfy requirements. Simulating this type of visual cognitive behavior by neural networks could help computers modify shapes to meet design requirements, as human designers do. When demonstrating the second type of sketching behavior, designers are able to see an ambiguous shape as different complete shapes so as to associate divergent design ideas. Another set of neural networks investigated in this study could also associate different shapes by adjusting the TSL and produce different idea sketches from the same shape.}

Specifically, this scheme is deployed to Neighborhood Rough Set (NRS) which is a typical NL methodology. And three major applications of NRS are concerned including approximation computation, neighborhood classification and feature selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NRS methodology enhanced by granular cabin consumes much less time. This study offers a promising solution that ensures the great potential of NL in big data.}

With this shift, from a former predominantly technocratic stance to something of a democratic stance on the style of management, it becomes important to elucidate public perceptions of environmental behavior. The paper examines this issue: from a rather specific perspective, where the role of time is significant; with a specific purpose in mind—for defining illustrative stakeholder aspirations for the future, whose plausibility is to be assessed against a computational model of lake behavior; and for a specific case study, Lake Lanier in the Chattahoochee watershed of Georgia, USA. Perturbations and variation in the behavior of the aquatic environment span many time frames, from the very short-term response associated with storms, infrastructure failure, transient pollution events, and so on, to the much longer-term, for instance, the biogeochemical ‘ageing’ of a lake over many decades and more. Our analysis is devoted to data from a survey of stakeholder imagination and perceptions of how the future state of Lake Lanier may evolve in the relatively short term (2–5 years) and in the long term, defined as 25+ years (the span of a generation). Overall, stakeholders are pessimistic and fear that things will be worse in the longer term. Guided largely by thinking on the perspectives of the social solidarities of Cultural Theory, extraction and analysis of sub-samples of the survey responses show that this outlook over the two frames of time is persistent, irrespective of what are, in principle, rather different ‘global’ attitudes towards the man-environment relationship. Of interest inter alia to the foresight generating procedure, by which the ‘reachability’ of stakeholder-derived futures for the lake is to be assessed using a computational model of the relevant parts of the science base, is the question of whether the same small number of priorities for further research on lake behavior is robust in the face of the rich variety of aspirations for the future inevitable in a democratic community of stakeholders.}

abstract = {Three different approaches show that, contrary to a longstanding conviction older than 160 years, the advance of Mercury’s perihelion can be achieved in Newtonian gravity with a very high precision by correctly analyzing the situation without neglecting Mercury’s mass. General relativity remains more precise than Newtonian physics, but Newtonian framework is more powerful than researchers and astronomers were thinking till now, at least for the case of Mercury. The Newtonian formula of the advance of planets’ perihelion breaks down for the other planets. The predicted Newtonian result is indeed too large for Venus and Earth. Therefore, it is also shown that corrections due to gravitational and rotational time dilation, in an intermediate framework which analyzes gravity between Newton and Einstein, solve the problem. By adding such corrections, a result consistent with the one of general relativity is indeed obtained. Thus, the most important results of this paper are two: (i) It is not correct that Newtonian theory cannot predict the anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of planets’ orbit. The real problem is instead that a pure Newtonian prediction is too large. (ii) Perihelion’s precession can be achieved with the same precision of general relativity by extending Newtonian gravity through the inclusion of gravitational and rotational time dilation effects. This second result is in agreement with a couple of recent and interesting papers of Hansen, Hartong and Obers. Differently from such papers, in the present work the importance of rotational time dilation is also highlighted. Finally, it is important to stress that a better understanding of gravitational effects in an intermediate framework between Newtonian theory and general relativity, which is one of the goals of this paper, could, in principle, be crucial for a subsequent better understanding of the famous Dark Matter and Dark Energy problems.}

The second program suggests a new approach and computational architecture for the cognitively-inspired anchoring of an agent’s learning, knowledge formation, and higher reasoning abilities in real-world interactions through a closed neural–symbolic acting/sensing–processing–reasoning cycle, potentially providing new foundations for future agent architectures, multi-agent systems, robotics, and cognitive systems and facilitating a deeper understanding of the development and interaction in human-technological settings.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of general hardware technology, microcomputers with multi-core CPUs have been widely applied in commercial services and household usage in the last ten years. Multi-core chips could, theoretically, lead to much better performance and computational efficiency than single-core chips. But so far, they have not shown general advantages for users, other than for operating systems and some specialized software. It is not easy to transform traditional single-core-based algorithms into multi-core-, multi-thread-based algorithms that can greatly improve efficiency, because of difficulties in computation and scheduling of hardware kernels, and because some programming languages cannot support multi-core, multi-thread programming. Therefore, a kind of multi-core-, multi-thread-based fast algorithm was designed and coded with Delphi language for the medium- and large-scale traveling salesman problem instances from TSPLIB, which can fully speed up the searching process without loss of quality. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed can, under the given hardware limitations, take full advantage of multi-core chips and effectively balance the conflict between increasing problem size and computational efficiency and thus acquire satisfactory solutions.}

We conclude the review by analyzing the frequency of modeling approaches in microbiology over time.

In such scenarios, a hierarchical model of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is considered to provide aerial computing services for ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this study, we investigate a hierarchical aerial computing system to optimally orchestrate the limited computation resources in both HAPs and UAVs. For offloading services, we formulate a joint resource allocation problem to maximize service satisfaction for terrestrial IoT devices. To solve this problem, we employ the ideas of game theory with centralized decision and decentralized execution. Through the Stackelberg-evolutionary game model, the HAP works as a leader, and selects its price strategy based on the evolutionary learning process. As followers, individual UAVs make decisions to partially offload their computing tasks by considering different objectives. According to the interactive control paradigm, our proposed method can get reciprocal advantages for HAPs, UAVs, and ground IoT devices while adaptively handling dynamic aerial network conditions. Finally, extensive simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm to increase the usability of edge servers’ computational resources. Compared with other existing state-of-the-art aerial network offloading protocols, we can improve the profits of system throughput, resource usability and UAV fairness up to 10 %, 10 %, and 15 %, respectively.}

Scaling up these simple computational principles to the social sphere outlines a path by which group members may adopt shared ideologies and beliefs to predict behavior and cooperate with each other. Because ideological judgments are of specific interest to others in our political groups, we may increasingly regulate each other’s thinking, sharing the process of error minimization. In this paper, we outline how this process of shared error minimization may lead to shared ideologies and beliefs that allow group members to predict and cooperate with each other, and how, as a consequence, political polarization and extremism may result.}

To this end, a foresight exercise is conducted with marine scientists and researchers in 6 countries in Europe. The exercise is designed in three stages: scanning, scenario-building and strategic orientation, and uses a combination of foresight methods to encourage creative thinking and exploration. The scenarios developed in the study describe alternative future worlds built on the establishment of self-sustaining communities and engaged societies; the diffusion of digitalisation and growth of blue biotechnologies; booming ecosystem services and open and collaborative research infrastructures that impact different sectors of the blue economy. A portfolio of research and innovation areas is developed that aims to inspire new research directions in four domains: (i) integrated ocean management tools; (ii) closed loop, circular polyculture systems; (iii) co-creation of innovation and transdisciplinary research; and (iv) open access and collaborative databases supporting ecosystem services. The study highlights the role of foresight in bridging across disciplinary perspectives and industry sectors. Foresight can be used to complement Decision-Support Systems and other quantitative approaches for research agenda-setting and for decision-making on policies addressing sustainability in the marine sciences.

Applying a complex systems perspective to public health evaluation may increase the relevance and strength of evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities. In this review of methods, we aimed to: (i) classify and describe different complex systems methods in evaluation applied to public health; and (ii) examine the kinds of evaluative evidence generated by these different methods.
Methods
We adapted critical review methods to identify evaluations of public health interventions that used systems methods. We conducted expert consultation, searched electronic databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), and followed citations of relevant systematic reviews. Evaluations were included if they self-identified as using systems- or complexity-informed methods and if they evaluated existing or hypothetical public health interventions. Case studies were selected to illustrate different types of complex systems evaluation.
Findings
Seventy-four unique studies met our inclusion criteria. A framework was developed to map the included studies onto different stages of the evaluation process, which parallels the planning, delivery, assessment, and further delivery phases of the interventions they seek to inform; these stages include: 1) theorising; 2) prediction (simulation); 3) process evaluation; 4) impact evaluation; and 5) further prediction (simulation). Within this framework, we broadly categorised methodological approaches as mapping, modelling, network analysis and ‘system framing’ (the application of a complex systems perspective to a range of study designs). Studies frequently applied more than one type of systems method.
Conclusions
A range of complex systems methods can be utilised, adapted, or combined to produce different types of evaluative evidence. Further methodological innovation in systems evaluation may generate stronger evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities in our complex world.}

abstract = {fMRI word decoding refers to decode what the human brain is thinking by interpreting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans from people watching or listening to words, representing a sort of mind-reading technology. Existing works decoding words from imaging data have been largely limited to concrete nouns from a relatively small number of semantic categories. Moreover, such studies use different word-stimulus presentation paradigms and different computational models, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the influence of different factors on fMRI word decoding. In this paper, we present a large-scale evaluation of eight word embedding models and their combinations for decoding fine-grained fMRI data associated with three classes of words recorded from three stimulus-presentation paradigms. Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (1) How does the brain-image decoder perform on different classes of words? (2) How does the brain-image decoder perform in different stimulus-presentation paradigms? (3) How well does each word embedding model allow us to decode neural activation patterns in the human brain? Furthermore, we analyze the most informative voxels associated with different classes of words, stimulus-presentation paradigms and word embedding models to explore their neural basis. The results have shown the following: (1) Different word classes can be decoded most effectively with different word embedding models. Concrete nouns and verbs are more easily distinguished than abstract nouns and verbs. (2) Among the three stimulus-presentation paradigms (picture, sentence and word clouds), the picture paradigm achieves the highest decoding accuracy, followed by the sentence paradigm. (3) Among the eight word embedding models, the model that encodes visual information obtains the best performance, followed by models that encode textual and contextual information. (4) Compared to concrete nouns, which activate mostly vision-related brain regions, abstract nouns activate broader brain regions such as the visual, language and default-mode networks. Moreover, both the picture paradigm and the model that encodes visual information have stronger associations with vision-related brain regions than other paradigms and word embedding models, respectively.}

We develop a General Polyhedral Approximation (GPA), in which the uncertainty set U is substituted by a finite set of polytopes derived from the vertex set of an arbitrary polytope that dominates U. The union of the polytopes need not contain U. We analyze and computationally test the performance of GPA for the frequently used budgeted uncertainty set U (with m rows). For budgeted uncertainty affine policies are known to be best possible approximations (if coefficients in the constraints are nonnegative for the second-stage decision). In practice calculating affine policies typically requires inhibitive running times. Therefore an approximation of U by a single simplex has been proposed in the literature. GPA maintains the low practical running times of the simplex based approach while improving the quality of approximation by a constant factor. The generality of our method allows to use any polytope dominating U (including the simplex). We provide a family of polytopes that allows for a trade-off between running time and approximation factor. The previous simplex based approach reaches a threshold at Γ>m after which it is not better than a quasi nominal solution. Before this threshold, GPA significantly improves the approximation factor. After the threshold, it is the first fast method to outperform the quasi nominal solution. We exemplify the superiority of our method by a fundamental logistics problem, namely, the Transportation Location Problem, for which we also specifically adapt the method and show stronger results.}

It is argued that the approach represents a practical method for dealing with uncertainties and lack of knowledge in risk assessment. If the computed probabilities meet the pre-defined criteria with the conservative quantities, there is strong support for the “real risk” to meet these criteria. In this paper we look more closely into this practice, the main aims being to clarify what it actually means and what the implications are, as well as providing some recommendations. The paper concludes that conservatism should be avoided in risk assessments – “best judgements” should be the ruling thinking, to allow for meaningful comparisons of options. By incorporating sensitivity analyses and strength of knowledge judgements for the background knowledge on which the assigned probabilities are based, the robustness of the conclusions can be more adequately assessed.}

(2000) [1] the slime mold Physarum polycephalum demonstrated its ability to solve shortest path problems. Biologists proposed a mathematical model, a system of differential equations, for the slime's adaption process (Tero et al., 2007) [3]. It was shown that the process convergences to the shortest path (Bonifaci et al., 2012) [5] for all graphs. We show that the dynamics actually converges for a much wider class of problems, namely undirected linear programs with a non-negative cost vector. Combinatorial optimization researchers took the dynamics describing slime behavior as an inspiration for an optimization method and showed that its discretization can ε-approximately solve linear programs with positive cost vector (Straszak and Vishnoi, 2016) [14]. Their analysis requires a feasible starting point, a step size depending linearly on ε, and a number of steps with quartic dependence on opt/(εΦ), where Φ is the difference between the smallest cost of a non-optimal basic feasible solution and the optimal cost (opt). We give a refined analysis showing that the dynamics initialized with any strongly dominating point converges to the set of optimal solutions. Moreover, we strengthen the convergence rate bounds and prove that the step size is independent of ε, and the number of steps depends logarithmically on 1/ε and quadratically on opt/Φ.}

abstract = {Code biology uses protein synthesis to pursue how living systems fabricate themselves. Weight falls on intermediary systems or adaptors that enable translated DNA to function within a cellular apparatus. Specifically, code intermediaries bridge between independent worlds (e.g. those of RNAs and proteins) to grant functional lee-way to the resulting products. Using this Organic Code (OC) model, the paper draws parallels with how people use artificial codes. As illustrated by Tetris and Morse, human players/signallers manage code functionality by using bodies as (or like) adaptors. They act as coding intermediaries who use lee-way alongside “a small set of arbitrary rules selected from a potentially unlimited number in order to ensure a specific correspondence between two independent worlds” (Barbieri, 2015). As with deep learning, networked bodily systems mesh inputs from a coded past with current inputs. Received models reduce ‘use’ of codes to a run-time or program like process. They overlook how molecular memory is extended by living apparatuses that link codes with functioning adaptors. In applying the OC model to humans, the paper connects Turing’s (1937) view of thinking to Wilson’s (2004) appeal to wide cognition. The approach opens up a new view of Kirsh and Maglio’s (1994) seminal studies on Tetris. As players use an interface that actualizes a code or program, their goal-directed (i.e. ‘pragmatic’) actions co-occur with adaptor-like ‘filling in’ (i.e. ‘epistemic’ moves). In terms of the OC model, flexible functions derive from, not actions, but epistemic dynamics that arise in the human-interface-computer system. Second, I pursue how a Morse radio operator uses dibs and dabs that enable the workings of an artificial code. While using knowledge (‘the rules’) to resemiotize by tapping on a transmission key, bodily dynamics are controlled by adaptor-like resources. Finally, turning to language, I sketch how the model applies to writing and reading. Like Morse operators, writers resemiotize a code-like domain of alphabets, spelling-systems etc. by acting as (or like) bodily adaptors. Further, in attending to a text-interface (symbolizations), a reader relies on filling-in that is (or feels) epistemic. Given that humans enact or mimic adaptor functions, it is likely that the OC model also applies to multi-modal language.}

To fill this gap, the present study examined two L2 writing teachers taking the initiative to create, update, and implement a human-computer-automatic writing evaluation (AWE) integral feedback platform, and how such a feedback innovation process impacted their feedback literacy development. The analysis of multiple sources of data, including semi-structured interviews, stimulated recalls, class observation, and artifacts, revealed that the two teachers approached the innovation by orchestrating mediating tools, interacting dialogically with social agents, reflecting critically, and crossing boundaries. Through this process, the development of teacher feedback literacy occurred at varying rates across different aspects. Specifically, positive changes were effected in the teachers’ feedback thinking as well as feedback giving and sharing practices. However, the teachers’ feedback literacy in classroom practice did not seem to have generated as salient a positive outcome. Possible reasons are discussed regarding the scope of the feedback innovation and contextual constraints, and implications are offered. The study underscored L2 writing teacher feedback literacy as a developmental phenomenon molded by situated social practice.}

We describe the method and its implementation for a Dirichlet problem with a single conservation law for the one-dimensional case. Numerical results for the one-dimensional law with the classical Burgers nonlinearity or the Buckley-Leverett equation show good numerical accuracy outside the neighborhood of the shocks. The error in the area of the shocks is of the order of the mesh size. The algorithm is well suited for execution on both massively parallel computers and vector machines. We present timing results for an Alliant FX/8, Connection Machine Model 2, and CRAY X-MP.}

Therefore, it is essential to invest in the technological development and deployment of electric buses for public transportation, directly enhancing the quality of life in large cities. From this perspective, this review examines a wide range of scientific literature on electric bus research using science mapping methods and content analysis to support critical thinking unveiling the main research streams, methods, and gaps of the field.

Furthermore, an a posteriori error estimator without multiplicative constants is derived for non-linear anisotropic problems, which measures the discretization error in the first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses in the L2-norm by solving local Neumann problems with equilibrated tractions.

This paper is about how well it has worked. This is reported in relation to two standards: (1) the value to thinking and action expressed by farmers and their consultants, (2) correspondence with theory about learning and judgement in uncertain external environments. The former utilises recorded narrative interviews with participants over many years. The latter uses a cognitive framework drawn from theory of judgment and decision making featuring the relationship between intuition and analysis (McCown, 2011). The cognitive theory framework makes sense of several evaluation surprises. The first was high enthusiasm by largely-intuitive farmers for an analytic approach to soil water in conjunction with a newly-appreciated “bucket” metaphor for water balance. The second surprise was the virtual absence of soil water measurement 10years later. This had been replaced by various intuitive estimates, calibrated to maintain a heuristic relationship with regard to the “bucket” as a resource. Farmers and their advisers were facilitated in using simulation for thought experiments and planning under climatic uncertainty. Benchmarking enabled problem solving in documented conditions. Scenario analysis using historical climate records supported thought experiments by providing probability distributions that were valued for shaping expectations as a “history of the future”. In retrospective evaluation interviews, researchers were surprised to find that yield forecasting and tactical decision making, anticipated to be analyses that were both site- and season-specific forecasts, had served farmers as “management gaming” simulations to aid formulating action rules for such conditions, thus reducing the need for an on-going decision-aiding service. Equipped with their soil monitoring techniques and with their heuristic rules, farmers still reserved a place for simulation “when you’ve got a planting situation out of the ordinary.”}

The continuous dynamical systems considered are ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For hybrid systems we concentrate on models that combine ODEs and discrete dynamics (e.g., finite automata). We review and compare four such models from the literature. Notions of simulation of a discrete dynamical system by a continuous one are developed. We show that hybrid systems whose equations can describe a precise binary timing pulse (exact clock) can simulate arbitrary reversible discrete dynamical systems defined on closed subsets of Rn. The simulations require continuous ODEs in R2n with the exact clock as input. All four hybrid systems models studied here can implement exact clocks. We also prove that any discrete dynamical system in Zn can be simulated by continuous ODEs in R2n + 1. We use this to show that smooth ODEs in R3 can simulate arbitrary Turing machines, and hence possess the power of universal computation. We use the famous asynchronous arbiter problem to distinguish between hybrid and continuous dynamical systems. We prove that one cannot build an arbiter with devices described by a system of Lipschitz ODEs. On the other hand, all four hybrid systems models considered can implement arbiters even if their ODEs are Lipschitz.}

Early theories in the 1950s posited that strict ideological doctrines may tend to attract individuals with dispositions towards mental rigidity. This question has persisted: Does psychological rigidity foster a tendency towards ideological extremism? This review evaluates the empirical landscape with respect to the rigidity-of-the-extreme and the rigidity-of-the-right hypotheses and offers conceptual and methodological recommendations for future research avenues. The evidence suggests that cognitive rigidity is linked to ideological extremism, partisanship, and dogmatism across political and non-political ideologies. Advances in the measurement of ideological extremity and cognitive rigidity will facilitate further elucidation regarding how exactly the two hypotheses may be reconciled and why they have been historically placed in a potentially false competition. This synthesis suggests that a scientifically rigorous understanding of the cognitive roots of ideological thinking may be essential for developing effective antidotes to intolerance and intergroup hostility.}

From maps sketched in sand to supercomputing software, humans ubiquitously enhance cognitive performance by creating and using artifacts that bear mental load [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This extension of information processing into the environment has taken center stage in debates about the nature of cognition in humans and other animals [6, 7, 8, 9]. How does the human mind acquire such strategies? In two experiments, we investigated the developmental origins of cognitive offloading in 150 children aged between 4 and 11 years. We created a memory task in which children were required to recall the location of hidden targets. In one experiment, participants were provided with a pre-specified cognitive offloading opportunity: an option to mark the target locations with tokens during the hiding period. Even 4-year-old children quickly adopted this external strategy and, in line with a metacognitive account, children across ages offloaded more often when the task was more difficult. In a second experiment, we provided children with the means to devise their own cognitive offloading strategy. Very few younger children spontaneously devised a solution, but by ages 10 and 11, nearly all did so. In a follow-up test phase, a simple prompt greatly increased the rate at which the younger children devised an offloading strategy. These findings suggest that sensitivity to the difficulties of thinking arises early in development and improves throughout the early school years, with children learning to modify the world around them to compensate for their cognitive limits.}

ERPs were recorded while participants sub-vocally produced high- and low-frequency disyllabic words that do or do not require sandhi. Sandhi words elicited more positive ERPs than non-sandhi words over left anterior channels around 336–520 ms after participants saw the cue instructing them to initiate sub-vocal production, but this effect was not significantly modulated by word frequency. These findings are consistent with predictions of the computation mechanism and have implications for current psycholinguistic models of speech production. (150 words)}

Computational materials databases are well-labelled and provide a fertile ground for predicting both ground-state and functional properties of materials. However, a clear design approach that allows prediction of materials with the desired functional performance does not yet exist. In this work, we train various machine learning models on a dataset curated from a combination of Materials Project as well as computationally calculated thermoelectric electronic power factor using a constant relaxation time Boltzmann transport equation (BoltzTrap). We show that simple random forest-based machine learning models outperform more complex neural network-based approaches on the moderately sized dataset and also allow for interpretability. In addition, when trained on only cubic material systems, the best performing machine learning model employs a perturbative scanning approach to find new candidates in Materials Project that it has never seen before, and automatically converges upon half-Heusler alloys as promising thermoelectric materials. We validate this prediction by performing density functional theory and BoltzTrap calculations to reveal accurate matching. One of those predicted to be a good material, NbFeSb, has been studied recently by the thermoelectric community; from this study, we propose four new half-Heusler compounds as promising thermoelectric materials – TiGePt, ZrInAu, ZrSiPd and ZrSiPt. Our approach is generalizable to extrapolate into previously unexplored material spaces and establishes an automated pipeline for the development of high-throughput functional materials.}

A three-site study compared performance on the d/s-IAT among participants aged 16–80 years with depression and prior suicide attempt (n = 82), with depression and no attempts (n = 80), and healthy controls (n = 86). Outcome measures included the standard difference (D) score, median reaction times, and error rates. Higher D scores represent a stronger association between death/suicide and self, while lower scores represent a stronger association between life and self. The D scores differed significantly among groups overall. Participants with depression exhibited higher scores compared to healthy controls, but there was no difference between participants with and without prior suicide attempts(F[2,242]=8.76, p<.001). Response times for participants with prior attempts differed significantly from other groups, with no significant differences in error rates. The D score was significantly affected by age (β =-0.007, t = 3.65, p<.001), with slowing of response times in older ages. Results suggest reaction time d/s-IAT D scores may not distinguish implicit thinking about suicide as response times slow with age, but slowed response times may be sensitive to suicide risk potentially indicating basic information processing deficits.}

The paper starts with introducing a systems approach to business modeling. A competitive business modeling technique, based on the author's planning techniques is applied. Systemic decisions are based on common organizational goals, and as such business planning and resource assignments should strive to satisfy higher organizational goals. It is critical to understand how different decisions affect and influence one another. Here, a business planning example is presented where systems thinking technique, using Causal Loops, are applied to complex management decisions. Predictive modeling specifics are briefed. A preliminary optimal game modeling technique is presented in brief with applications to innovation and R&D management. Conducting gap and risk analysis can assist with this process. Example application areas to e-commerce with management simulation models are examined.}

However, stakeholder conflicts and supply–demand uncertainties pose significant challenges. This study proposes a bi-level interaction framework for coordinated planning, optimizing shared energy storage pricing via genetic algorithms to determine optimal leasing, scheduling, and configuration strategies, exhibiting strong scalability and adaptability in large-scale systems. Wasserstein metric-distributed robust optimization and stochastic planning address supply–demand uncertainties, enhancing robustness and reducing the model’s over-conservatism. Leveraging complementary charging and discharging behaviors, the model minimizes storage investment, improves resource utilization, stabilizes the system, and achieves over 95% renewable energy absorption, fostering a sustainable business model. Given the diversification of energy storage technologies, a rigorous value assessment method is essential. This study constructs an economic–social–environmental evaluation framework for shared energy storage based on life cycle thinking, externality theory, and sharing economy principles. Employing the analytic hierarchy process, the framework quantifies stakeholder benefits, responsibility allocation, and profit potential, including arbitrage from off-peak storage and peak-time discharge, grid pressure alleviation, and enhanced renewable energy integration. Finally, analysis of subsidy policies and the positive externalities of expanding peak-to-valley differentials offers policy insights for cleaner, more resilient, and sustainable energy systems.}

Works of renowned authors, as well as some of their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of enactive approach. We indicate that the enactive approach transcends its original context within biology, and at a second moment within connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. The influence on computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic and alive machines. Finally, the article stresses the importance of the enactive approach in the design of agents, understanding that previous approaches have very different cognitive architectures and that a prototypical model of enactive cognitive architecture is one of the largest challenges today.}

This book about graphic design provides a channel for clear communication that supports visual thinking and acts as an interface to the vast information resources of the modern world. Visual thinking is a process that has the allocation of attention as its very essence. Attention, however, is multifaceted. Making an eye movement is an act of attending. Eye movements are executed to satisfy the need for information and can be thought of as a sequence of visual queries on the visual world. The idea of the visual query is shorthand for what one does when obtaining information either from the world at large or from some kind of information display. Understanding what visual queries are easily executed is a critical skill for the designer. The special skill of designers is not so much skill with drawing or graphic design software, although these are undoubtedly useful, but the talent to analyze a design in terms of its ability to support the visual queries of others. One reason why design is difficult is that the designer already has the knowledge expressed in the design and has seen it develop from inception and therefore cannot see it with fresh eyes. The solution is to be analytic and this is where this book is intended to have value. Effective design should start with a visual task analysis, determine the set of visual queries to be supported by a design, and then use color, form, and space to efficiently serve those queries.}

In response to the global shift to remote learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic, VLEs, which include learning management systems (LMS) and online collaboration platforms, gained prominence. The proposed work leverages an established Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory to propose eight metrics, which collectively form a part of Cognitive Evaluation Metrics (CEM). The proposed metrics introduce a novel computational approach for multimode evaluation of learners’ cognitive abilities for each learning task within a learning environment. The paper details the formalism for the evaluation of the metrics and makes a contribution towards the potential of the proposed methodology to evaluate cognitive abilities. Additionally, the work implements CEM integration into the learner module of a Game-Based Learning (GBL) environment. Analysis of simulations in the GBL environment, along with statistical analysis, provides insights into the normal distribution of cognitive metrics. This reveals diverse ranges in various abilities such as long or short term memory, working memory, reasoning, attention, and processing speed. The paper also explores the impact of virtual assistants, which highlights their limited relevance to enhance cognitive abilities but serve as valuable on-demand support resources.}

Hofstede's cultural dimensions were also integrated into the investigation in order to facilitate mediation in an evaluative context. Students' performances (N = 25) from a São Paulo-Brazil public school were statistically evaluated. Their cultural profile was determined via the Hofstede Value Survey Model 1994 questionnaire. The elaborative process of arranging concept maps was individual (CM-individual) and integrated with HDC in groups (CM-HDC). Concept map assessment methods were based off existing literature. An improvement in students' performances (p < 0.05) that presented concept maps integrated to HDC in a more complex structure when compared to individually-built maps was observed. Employment of HDC helped form motivational/interactive dialogues between students and teachers, which, in turn, assisted in achieving greater learning through the use of concept maps.

abstract = {In this paper we aim to give an analysis and cognitive rationalization of a common practice or strategy of modeling in systems biology known as a middle-out modeling strategy. The strategy in the cases we look at is facilitated through the construction of what can be called mesoscopic models. Many models built in computational systems biology are mesoscopic (midsize) in scale. Such models lack the sufficient fidelity to serve as robust predictors of the behaviors of complex biological systems, one of the signature goals of the field. This puts some pressure on the field to provide reasons for why and how these practices are warranted despite not meeting the stated goals of the field. Using the results of ethnographic study of problem-solving practices in systems biology, we aim to examine the middle-out strategy and mesoscopic modeling in detail and to show that these practices are rational responses to complex problem solving tasks on cognitive grounds in particular. However making this claim requires us to update the standard notion of bounded rationality to take account of how human cognition is coupled to computation in these contexts. Our account fleshes out the idea that has been raised by some philosophers on the “hybrid” nature of computational modeling and simulation. What we call “coupling” both extends modelers’ capacities to handle complex systems, but also produces various cognitive and computational constraints which need to be taken into account in any computational problem solving strategy seeking to maintain insight and control over the models produced.}

Experiments were performed in two middle schools and included 8th graders in two experiments and 7th graders in nine experiments. Mathematics topics ranged from fractions to integers to geometry. As in the literature experiments, students were in their normal school environment following their regular curriculum and were unaware that their learning was being observed. Guided Cognition design was found to be effective for learning mathematics. Working story problems that were enriched with cognitive events such as role play, divergent thinking, visualizing and illustrating, and relating to prior experience raised scores on unexpected quizzes by about a letter grade. Another unexpected quiz found that the improvements in problem-solving performance persisted for 6months. Guided Cognition homework was also found to be efficient in that students who worked eight problems and then performed four cognitive events performed as well on unexpected quizzes as students who worked 24 problems in the same time interval. Another pair of experiments determined that modest gains could be made from merely reading completed examples of cognitive events, but that these gains were not long-lasting. Performing the cognitive events was found to be most effective for long-term performance. Another experiment found that experiencing cognitive events after working some mathematics problems can help consolidate knowledge of how to work such problems.}

Unfortunately, according to the latest national test results, most students lack mathematical problem solving skills. This proves to be one of the reasons why overall achievement in mathematics is considered quite low. It also reflects that students have difficulties in comprehending mathematical problems affecting the process of problem-solving. Therefore, in order to allow teachers to establish a proper teaching plan suitable for students’ learning process, this research aims to analyze the difficulties in mathematical problem solving among elementary school students. Samples are divided into two groups, elementary school students and mathematics teachers. Data collection was conducted by structured interview, documentary analysis, and survey tests. Data analysis was conducted by descriptive statistics, and content analysis. The results suggest that there are several difficulties in problem solving, namely 1) Students have difficulties in understanding the keywords appearing in problems, thus cannot interpret them in mathematical sentences. 2) Students are unable to figure out what to assume and what information from the problem is necessary to solving it, 3) Whenever students do not understand the problem, they tend to guess the answer without any thinking process, 4) Students are impatient and do not like to read mathematical problems, and 5) Students do not like to read long problems. Therefore, the results found in this research will lead to the creation and the development of mathematical problem solving diagnostic tests for teachers, in order to improve students’ mathematical problem solving skills.}

abstract = {Innovative methods in data collection and analytics for pest and disease management are advancing together with computational efficiency. Tools, such as the open-data kit, research electronic data capture, fall armyworm monitoring, and early warning- system application and remote sensing have aided the efficiency of all types of data collection, including text, location, images, audio, video, and others. Concurrently, data analytics have also evolved with the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) for early warning and decision-support systems. ML has repeatedly been used for the detection, diagnosis, modeling, and prediction of crop pests and diseases. This paper thus highlights the innovations, implications, and future progression of these technologies for sustainability.}

abstract = {In this paper, in order to investigate the effect of graphene oxide (GO) interlayer spacing on the overall mechanical properties of GO/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanocomposite, the uniaxial tensile simulation on the computational model of GO/TPU nanocomposite with monolayer and bilayer graphene sheets were carried out. During the tensile process, the variation of potential energy, void percentage, tensile strain contour, and density distribution with tensile strain were applied to analyze the underlying microscopic mechanism of stress change of monolayer GO/TPU system. The results show that when the system was within the stress yield region, the micro rearrangement motion and relative sliding of TPU chains play a major role. Furthermore, when the system enters into the stress softening region until stress failure, the void formation and nuclear within the system dominates the stress change, which is attributed to the interfacial structure of GO/TPU. Subsequently, based on the above-mentioned results in the case of monolayer GO/TPU result, the effects of different layer spacings on the overall mechanical properties of GO/TPU nanocomposite system were discussed by varying the spacing of GO layers. The results show that with the increase of GO layer spacing, the elastic modulus and yield strength of the system show a tendency of increasing and then decreasing, and the failure strain is the opposite, and when the GO dispersion is better, it can also play the role of delayed damage failure of the system.}

To complement the abstract sketches regularly used in cell biology, we propose DynBioSketch, an easy-to-use digital modeling and animation tool, enabling biologists to resort to less simplified representations when necessary without having to call professional artists. DynBioSketch is an interactive sketching system dedicated to the design and communication of biological phenomena at the cellular scale that can be illustrated in a few minutes of animation. Our model integrates 3D modeling, pattern-based design of 3D shape distributions, and sketch-based animation. These elements can be combined to create complex scenarios such as the infection phenomenon on which we focus, allowing a narrative design adapted to communication between researchers or educational applications in biology. Our results, along with a user study conducted with biology researchers, highlight the potential of DynBioSketch in enabling the direct design of dynamic visual summaries that convey relevant information, as shown in our infection case study. By bridging the gap between abstract representations used by experts and more illustrative depictions, DynBioSketch opens a new avenue for communicating biological concepts.}

abstract = {Attribute reduction plays a crucial role in knowledge discovery, and sequential three-way decision (S3WD) provides a new method for attribute reduction. However, the three regions of the S3WD model are usually represented as three sets, which leads to two disadvantages. On one hand, it is difficult to obtain the condition of a decision rule when multiple equivalence classes are merged into a set because different equivalence classes have different descriptions. On the other hand, if the boundary region of the upper level of S3WD is a set, one has to partition the upper level with all the acquired attributes rather than the newly added attribute. That is, there is double counting. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to retain the topology of equivalence classes in S3WD, and how to use this topology to enhance semantic interpretation and improve computational efficiency. To this end, a granular version of S3WD, called granular sequential three-way decision (GS3WD), is first developed to retain the information structure of equivalence classes. And then, three acceleration strategies and an efficient granular sequential three-way reduction (GS3WR) are proposed. Finally, a concept tree can be generated simultaneously in the process of GS3WR, and the decision rules with multi-granularity can be extracted from this concept tree directly. Experimental results show that GS3WR can obtain the same core attributes and reducts as the representative attribute reduction algorithms in rough sets and the computational efficiency is improved by hundreds of times.}

abstract = {Tea, a globally cultivated crop renowned for its unique flavor profile and health-promoting properties, ranks among the most favored functional beverages worldwide. However, diseases severely jeopardize the production and quality of tea leaves, leading to significant economic losses. While early and accurate identification coupled with the removal of infected leaves can mitigate widespread infection, manual leaves removal remains time-consuming and expensive. Utilizing robots for pruning can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs. However, the accuracy of object detection directly impacts the overall efficiency of pruning robots. In complex tea plantation environments, complex image backgrounds, the overlapping and occlusion of leaves, as well as small and densely harmful leaves can all introduce interference factors. Existing algorithms perform poorly in detecting small and densely packed targets. To address these challenges, this paper collected a dataset of 1108 images of harmful tea leaves and proposed the YOLO-DBD model. The model excels in efficiently identifying harmful tea leaves with various poses in complex backgrounds, providing crucial guidance for the posture and obstacle avoidance of a robotic arm during the pruning process. The improvements proposed in this study encompass the Cross Stage Partial with Deformable Convolutional Networks v2 (C2f-DCN) module, Bi-Level Routing Attention (BRA), Dynamic Head (DyHead), and Focal Complete Intersection over Union (Focal-CIoU) Loss function, enhancing the model’s feature extraction, computation allocation, and perception capabilities. Compared to the baseline model YOLOv8s, mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP0.5) increased by 6%, and Floating Point Operations Per second (FLOPs) decreased by 3.3 G.}

abstract = {Stormwater source controls have been adopted worldwide to address hydrological and environmental impairments caused by the spread of impervious surfaces in cities. Current design method in China uses 30-year daily rainfall records to generate relationship of rainfall volume capture ratio (αg) and daily design storm, and then uses design storm to propose design solution. However, source control performance differs from rain to rain, and hence the design solution's actual effect may deviate from αg. Borrowing closed-loop feedback concept from business domain, this study proposes closed-loop analysis (CLA) which uses design solution's 30-year simulated result as data feedback to check design solution's effectiveness and then make improvements if necessary. It consists of four methods: 1) hourly design storm statistical method, for addressing the weakness of current daily design storm; 2) design solution model credibility examination method, for guaranteeing credibility of 30-year simulated results for CLA; 3) appropriate design storms determination method for source control without underdrain; 4) additional design parameters optimization method for source control with underdrain. Taking Xiamen city for example, case study results shows that design solution's 30-year simulated results were consistent/comparable with sizing calculation formula that was used to propose design solution, and therefore they were credible for CLA. Appropriate design storms ensured design solutions without underdrain to achieve the intended αg±3 %. Optimal design parameters combinations ensured design solutions with underdrain to achieve αg but also restore natural runoff events with pre- and post-development runoff frequency spectra similarity being 0.670–0.691. Based on stormwater mathematical model, CLA can drive source control design computation to a new methodological stage.}

This paper unravels the transformative power of technologies on: the tourism actors and resources (both the traditional but also new actors, i.e. the technology agents); the ways actors interact to (co-)create but also (co-)destruct tourism value; and the context in which tourism actors interact from a linear supply chain tourism ‘industry’ to a complex socio-technical smart tourism ecosystem. To study such complex phenomena and transformations, the paper emphasises that research should not only adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, but it also needs to follow an anti-disciplinary thinking whereby new knowledge and constructs do not simply fall within existing paradigms, disciplinary silos and mindsets once developed by studying the ‘pure’ humans and their behaviours.}

Previously, a method for computationally structuring patent databases as a basis for an automated design-by-analogy tool was introduced. To demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses, a computationally-generated structure is compared to four expert designers' mental models of the domain. Results indicate that, compared to experts, the computationally-generated structure is sensible in clustering of patents and organization of clusters. The computationally-generated structure represents a space in which experts can find common ground/consensus – making it promising to be intuitive/accessible to broad cohorts of designers. The computational method offers a resource-efficient way of usefully conceptualizing the space that is sensible to expert designers, while maintaining an element of unexpected representation of the space.}
